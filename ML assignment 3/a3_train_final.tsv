1/0	"I would stick to the traditional ones." mRNA vaccines don't do anything that regular vaccines don't already do. And on top of that they have fewer ingredients (which reduces the chance of a negative reaction in your body.) They don't need those ingredients because they don't need to preserve any live or attenuated virus in the liquid. Most of what is inside the vaccine is the spike protein RNA and that's it. That's also why they need to be stored at cold temperatures because they're preserved by temperature not by extra ingredients (that you could be allergic to.) Essentially it's a safer technology. Saying you want to use an older technology over an improved technology because you think the older one is safer... I mean think about it. Would you drive an older car with fewer safety features over a newer car with more safety features... just because the older car has been on the road longer and we know what it's like? Similar situation here. Just something to think about.

I was absolutely dreading this...but after a little while I was so relieved and excited I got it over with. If anyone still hasn't got their shot, I would recommend you get the right mindset before getting the shot and to stay away from stories on the internet about peoples horror stories of side effects. Seriously, you need to look after your mind as much as your body. Anxiety wrecks havoc on your mind if you let it. Take someone with you to help get your mind off of it.

1/1	@TheGamingCanadian what??? Yes and the same thing all the cells have to do to create all the proteins in your body… your body transcribes dna to mRNA then to a protein. Virus hijack this process then use your proteins to manufacture its mRNA into copies of itself. The vaccine also uses this process just to create a singular spike protein to train your immune system. To my understanding with an mRNA vaccine

0/0	@idefyu23 the vaccine will be short-lived only last about 3 months. You will need to continually get this vaccine over and over again, just like the flu shot.
1/-1	@jack @TwitterSafety @TwitterSupport are you actually looking at misinformation and flat out lies this account is spreading about the Covid Vaccine? You need to have that in reporting category.
1/-1	@jonathans4503 No it's not a lie. The side-effects are monitored EXTENSIVELY and on a mass scale to see if there is a higher incidence of medical conditions in the vaccine group compared to the control group (in this case the unvaccinated background population.) That's the best way to see what the vaccine does to people. It was done in the clinical trials and now we have even more data to show it's safe. With actual comparable data with a trial group and a control group. Anecdotes and facebook posts are not medical evidence of anything.
1/1	@lucianaromulus1408 If you are ignorant of the science here - which you clearly are - do not add to that by imbecilic statements....... = simply admit your lack of knowledge. p.s. - Covid from an epidemiological standpoint = worse that Ebola......... - as it is far more communicable and hence its' societal impact is greater.
1/-1	@maryashakil #SARSCoV2 variants are humbling scientists and clinicians. Should we have gone for #PfizerBiontech vaccine? "Full immunization was 90% effective at protecting people against infection, and a single dose was 80% effective" https://t.co/5jFJosik1x
1/1	@souljacem yes the real inventor of this mRNA vaccine is a Hungarian Scientist Katalin Karikó the world should be thanking her for decades long of dedication without her mRNA covid vaccine would not be possible and the production of the vaccine could be stalled for years edit: american Scientist Weismann co-invented the mRNA with her so both are equally important to the discovery of the vaccine
1/0	@tedcruz We can ask the same of you. Leading an insurrection. Gerrymandering Texas voting districts. Going to Cancun during the freeze. Spreading vaccine misinformation. Not supporting masks mandates. Not supporting women's rights despite having daughters. RESIGN.
1/0	@truthseeker8784 You mentioned the difference: the vaccine is weaker. That is the whole point of a vaccine. Your body gets the chance to find a solution against it without the risk of the pathogen overtaking your body in the meantime. Natural immunity doesn't do that. That is like putting you in a cage with a Lion to protect against lions...
0/0	@ukrokopilochka @sputnikvaccine NO, they didn't. The Lancet article it's not the entire content of the 3rd phase and there is no info about the secondary effects of the vaccine. So #SputnikV it's not a 100% safe vaccine as @sputnikvaccine says. That's the complete truth.

0/0	A good friend got brain encephalitis from the vax as well. After weeks in hospital, she recovered. Later the doctors in the sam e hospital said to her, she should get another shot from the same vaccine as a booster because her body now knows the ingredients. She never got another jab. I wish everyone who was injured from the vax will recover as good as possible.
1/-1	A good friend of mine had her husband die in his sleep because he got Covid and it did a number on his heart. He was like 42. He wasn't vaccinated and when their kid brought it home he got it much worse than the rest for their household.

0/-1	A lot of people regret taking the vaccine and felt unfairly pressured and mislead about its true impact. I got covid shortly after taking them anyway and took a risk on an unknown treatment. Friends and family have had negative impacts developing myocarditis and other immune abnormalities shortly after. The benefit was overstated and the risks not fully explored.
0/0	A lot of people who took the vaccination said they made a terrible mistake
1/1	A lot of vaccine haters don't respond to contradicting replies... It's really sad when somebody refuses to convert to an actual educated opinion
1/1	A major reason vaccines can take so long to develop is that you have to get enough clinical trial volunteers and then wait for them to potentially come into contact with the disease the vaccine is designed to protect against. It's been very easy to find volunteers across the world and Covid is very prevalent around the world, so this hasn't been an issue this time. Not to mention every major biotech company and government pulled all focus and resources because this is priority #1 on everyone's To-Do list. Imagine how much faster you could get something done at work if everyone at the office prioritized your emails and their time to your project. [that's the dream, right?] Finally, mRNA vaccines have been in development for a long time, and we got a head start with the SARS research. Luckily, this wasn't the case where we had to start from scratch.
0/0	A mature vaccine is the result of extensive trial and error, so a newly released vaccine in a short time carries high risks. That’s common sense.

0/0	A vaccine that doesn't stop the transmission of the virus is useless.
1/1	A vaccine will never ensure 100% protection against a virus but can prevent a dose of a virus being more lethal to you as your immune system is trained on a weaker strain of the virus. It can mean the difference between feeling tired and cold or ending up on a ventilator
0/0	A virus so deadly you need to be tested to know you have it, and a vaccine so safe that they need to threaten your livelihood and take away your freedom and strong arm you into taking it.

0/0	ACHTUALLY... THESE ARE NOT A VACCINES. These are small MRNA packages, technically designed to stimulate the human cell into becoming pathogen creators. It's just disguised as a vaccine to sneak past public health exemptions. Vaccine is a legally defined term under public health law, look it up. This is genetic engineering. If you get this injection, you'll have cells in your body that will produce protein to which your immune system will amount an immune response. That's called an auto-immune disease.

1/1	About to be a first time mom and I have always been pro vaccine but, becoming a parent has made me much more skeptical and just wanting to do best by my child and I'm so glad I came across this video! I appreciate the transparency about the risks and the process behind getting vaccines rolled out. I think that is what the public needs. We don't want to be "sold" that these vaccines are 1000% percent safe and nothing bad ever occurs from them but rather just sensible data, and the reason you're receiving it like Dr. Mike said. Because of the transparency of this video I will be getting my child fully vaccinated and feel confident to do so!

1/1	Absolutely get the vaccine!!
1/1	Absolutely minor in the great scheme of things but people thinking they contracted the flu from the flu shot. Impossible but you can’t convince them. You explain it’s flu season either you were exposed already or it wasn’t a strain covered by this year’s vaccine

0/1	After my entire house gets COVID three times but I'm safe
1/1	After my first AstraZeneca vaccine jab, I went back to work immediately after, and not until dinner time the very evening, started feeling extremely lethargic, tired and weak all over. At one point when sitting down, it’s so difficult to even get back up - the ‘sensation’ was peculiar, like being half drunk, yet with a perfectly clear mind at the same time. However the first night’s sleep was nevertheless fantastic, had gone straight into dreams and I was feeling refreshed the next morning.
1/1	After my first Pfizer vaccine I felt tired and slept a bit. Nothing else. After my 2. shot I felt tired as well, had a slight fever and headaches for a couple of days. It felt like a cold is coming. My arm was not swollen, red or anything. Totally worth it.

1/1	After teaching kids for over 40 years, I know how quickly illnesses spread. I got my vaccine as soon as I could, and I encourage everyone to do the same. It’s about keeping our communities safe.
1/1	After the community announced the vaccination schedule, the neighbors cooperated well. It feels like people are more confident in dealing with the pandemic.
0/0	After the first shot, I developed oil problems on my whole body. I still am fighting it three years later. Seem to be contained to All the hair on my body.
1/1	After the second shot, euphoria. Elation. A different kind of relief, that the nightmare of fearing for my life each time I left the house would soon be over. Like a vast weight had been lifted from my chest. Freedom was on the horizon.
0/0	After the shot 4 months later my best friend died
1/1/1	After the shot, I can now go back to practice my hobby, which is living. I couldn't wait to get the second shot and finish the vaccination protocol. Covid is a nasty illness - vaccination is the way out of this.

Two years later, got covid and all came back again. It's been almost a year and a half and deafness and tinnitus are here to stay. Still off balance but better than when it started. Quality of life is definitely not what it was!!
1/-1	After viewing this video, I haven't gotten any better understanding of how the vaccines work.
1/1	After watching this I really feel relaxed cuz I got vaccination a day before yesterday and got fever body pain and coughing. Dr prescribed me only paracetamol 2 time a day. Now I feel very better. Stay blessed. Go get your vaccine today.
1/-1	After watching this video I am seriously thinking about parents who don’t have any knowledge should not be able to make this choice
0/0	After watching this video, it reconfirms my fears that these Covid vaccines are even more dangerous that I had imagined.........
0/-1	Again trying to manipulate the truth standing up for your freedom is not a conspiracy
1	Again, it's so easy to get educated about genetics these days. Just do some basic reading. It's all at your fingertips. There's no need to spread misinformation.
0/0	Again. The lies get better and better
1/1	Agree it should be mandated just as all other vaccines are
1/-1	Agree: the public pushback on public health measures has made things worse for future pandemics.
0/0	Agreed. I mistrust vaccines and flu shots now.
0/0	Ahahaha I love how they end with 'not getting vaccinated is still more dangerous' LOL right! Sure it is!!
0/0	Ain’t nobody tryna be a guinea pig for big pharma

1/1	Alhamdulillah I Got Vaccinated First Dose Of Covishield Vaccine 🇮🇳🇮🇳 👏👏
1/1	All 3 authorized vaccines—Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J—are safe and incredibly effective. Each one is shown to prevent hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. Keep yourself safe and help end this pandemic by getting vaccinated when it’s your turn.
1/1	All COVID-19 vaccinations have gone through rigorous testing and approval processes, and are safe to use for the general public.
1/0	All I can say is that after a gazillion COVID vaccines, my 5G still sucks in downtown Minneapolis..😂
0/0	All I know is that I have not “felt” the same since my 2nd Pfizer booster. I am chronically tired to the point of exhaustion with an increase in pain in those areas of my body affected by arthritis/joint disease. I’ve changed nothing with my regular regime (eating, food, meds, sleep, etc). The changes I’m experiencing are having a deletirious effect on my quality of life. I do not expect to find the information I’m searching for since of course, my questions involve Big Parma, lots of shareholders making lots of money, etc.
0/0	All I need to know is that I'm not taking it.
1/1	All I want for Christmas is a vaccine.
1/1	All current recommended and proven vaccines have been proven time and again to provide more benefit on average than they harm.
0/0	All efficacy claims are false.
1/1	All evidence shows that being vaccinated greatly reduces your chances of getting the Delta variant and, if you do still get it, limits the damage caused by it.
1/1/0	All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations of the IRB.
1/1	All muste take it!!!
1/1	All my family members got 1st and 2nd does of covid vaccination, and they're fine.
1/1	All my vaccinated friends got through COVID mild or asymptomatic. Unvaccinated ones? Hospitalized. That’s all I need to know. 🏥
1/1	All needs to be vaccinated. I finished my dose in November, it is necessary. Now l have the certificate.
1/1	All of my family have had covid, but all of us have gotten/ are getting the vaccine
0/0	All of the people with side effects, lives ruined, dead athletes, for a vaccine that doesn't immunized you... this promoted the worst solution for co\/id, Karma will get you all
0/0	All of the purveyors of this lie must be permanently "removed". Nothing less will do.
1/1	All of the supposed problems with the vaccine are either made up or ridiculously overblown. The risks are minimal, the rewards are vast.
0/0	All of you are drug mafia. Just doing business with the life of others. Countries making such virous should be punished and band. But they are slave of those countries. And uno is also playing their part to do nothing.
0/0	All of you dont see something wrong with receiving a placebo shot. And going home with a smile.
1/1	All people that are against the vaccine are dumb conspiracy theorist
1/1	All praise vaccines!
1/1	All seven COVID-19 vaccines that have completed large efficacy clinical trials are very effective in preventing severe COVID. Not one vaccinated person has gotten sick enough to require hospitalization. Not a single vaccinated person has died of COVID-19.
0/0	All side effects are under reported. All benefits are exaggerated. Long term risks are high.
0/0	All staff-members of this Vaccine circus —> Life in Prison ! I made me very sick, almost died !
1/0	All studies show that people who are vaccinated have more health problems. This goes for all vaccinations. The more vaccinations the more health problems we have. ￼
1/1/1/1	All the anti vaxers told me i was gonna get all these horrible symptoms. 3 months later and i feel nothin
1/1	All the boosters. Never get sick of anything anymore. Must be some far out mRNA magic.
1/1	All the delusional anti vaxxers, I hope you all win Darwin Awards
0/0	All the people I know who never had covid, including myself, are also "vaccine" free.
0/1	All the people in the comments being like AHA GOTCHA I was right all along, go look at the side effects of basically everything else you ingest smoke or are prescribed 😂
1/0	All the people laughing should just move to an island with all the other disease spreaders and infect each other all the live long day. Maybe the stupid problem we have in this country will take care of itself
0/0	All the unvaccinated I know never got sick from COVID. Why would you even bother with the jab?
0/0	All the unvaccinated have 1 thing in common...NO REGRETS NOT taking that lethal shot
0/0	All the vaccinated will come to consider it the worst choice of their lives. Those that don't die first anyway. If a billion people survive the next few years, it'll be a lot. The deaths we see now really are just side effects btw. They never meant for it to kill, just to destroy our natural immunities so we would be defenseless against disease x, another lab made covid variant that kills only those who had their DNA modified in a very safe and effective way.
1/1	All the vaccines I took as a kid were tested and actually worked.
1/1/1	All the vaccines are good. Safe and effective.
1/1	All the vaccines have been used on 10s of millions of people and they have been proven to be very safe.
1/1	All these anti-vax memes will never die, which is actually pretty ironic.
1/1	All these people saying this is not worthy of a museum, try to learn some history. This vaccine for Covid will save millions of lives. This person is an example of the human race taking the risk to save those lives. For example when Polio Vaccines were finally being distributed: "It was a celebration worth remembering 50 years later. Throughout the nation on April 12, 1955, church bells rang out, kids were let out of school, people danced in the streets. "Polio routed!" newspaper headlines screamed. "Salk's vaccine works!" [Article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-04-12-0504120316-story.html) - just one that I found doing a simple search. "It's hard to imagine an era when people had more confidence that science would solve their problems if everybody did his part. Polio--a major childhood crippler and killer--was the first disease to be attacked and publicized in ways we now take for granted. Poster children appeared for the first time; celebrities rushed to do public service announcements. "This is a great American story. Everybody had a stake in it," said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan who directs the Center for the History of Medicine. "Parents gave freely to the March of Dimes, a private charity, to pay for the research. They were clamoring to get their kids in experimental trials--polio could paralyze or kill you, but they were completely confident that Salk's vaccine would be safe."
0/0	All this diseases targeted Africa to loot it with a fake diseases since we do not have doctorsthey will pretend as if they sell us some vaccinations and get more access into our mineral resources.
0/0	All those that pushed these deadly injections should be brought to the Hague for crimes against humanity.. Study after study peer review papers. These shots should be pulled from the shelf.
0/0	All us tin hats told everyone but very few listened sadly. It’s very sad that so many and their children’s children will suffer long term as a result
0/0	All vaccinated women become sterile and humanity is decimated ( and thats probably whats made for) I could call it Darwin's selection, but that's kind of mean, right? I mean its not about being smart or not ...its about you got an biological education or not. : The more educated you are .....you don't want the vaccine. really NOT.
1/1	All vaccines against Covid-19 are effective and provide good protection against the disease.
0/0	All vaccines are poison including animal vaccines.
0/0	All vaccines have side effects that why wise people like myself refused to get vaccinated. Were you vaccinated Nick?
1/1	All vaccines now keep people from death, hospitalization and severe symptoms so it is safe 100% for all. thank you very much for information.
0/0	All vax danger for Security 🎩
0/1	All well and dandy - but what about long-term side effects? This is something that cannot be sped up by money - you need time to confirm whether there are or aren't any if you don't simply wait and see. I'm not an anti-vaccine person, I do take my shots - but I definatelly will avoid this one until sufficient time passes so that we can really deem the new drug safe or not. Don't get me wrong - I'm all about boosting my own immunity to protect others - but not at the cost of my own health. Simple. There were multiple cases of initially believed safe drugs that were expected to be beneficial to both individual and society - so people took it. And instead of benefitting anyone the end result was that there were more people in need of intense care. This does not help! It only makes matters worse!
0/0	All while the vaccinated White House Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, tests positive for COVID a 2nd time!!!! But hey…she didn’t die
0/0	All who participated ( gov officials, journalists, doctors etc) in this scam please apply the Nuremberg code !!
0/0	All you have to do is avoid vaccination.
0/0	All you need to know is that there are perfectly healthy young teens who are now on life support in the hospital after taking the vaccine
1/0	Almost 4 years later, and none of us regret not getting it.
0/1	Almost all of the people I know who are 60 years and above who got COVID have had the lasting effect of fatigue and shortness of breath even after full vaccination and booster shots.
1/1	Almost everyone I know who died from Covid were unvaccinated and a few died before a vaccine was available. Their families usually lied and said that they had been vaccinated although they were not. Most were regular church attenders (Evangelicals) and Trumpers. I have no sympathy for them as my empathy level is at an all time low...
0/0	Almost everyone became weak after COVID vaccine
1/1	Almost totally avoidable illness and death. I hope the antivax - antimask crowd are proud of themselves.
1/1	Already got my vaccine and booster shot, doing well. It’s been a month or so and no further complications.
0/0/0	Already had covid, tested positive for the antibodies, why would I vaccinate?
1/1	Already vaccinated since February. of course you should get the vaccine, it's hard to understand why you shouldn't get it.
1/1	Also COVID is bad for people. The more I read, the more I hear about clotting, as a result of COVID, causing long term issues. At such an early age, who knows what developmental issues will become of the condition. Hopefully none, but it didn't stop me from vaccination my child.
0/-1	Also doctor, please include the FACT that only 1% adverse vaccinations events are actually reported.
1/0	Also pro-vax and planning to get our daughter vaccinated according to the CDC schedule. But we will also be opting out of the Covid vaccine. Since it’s relatively new, I’d rather err on the side of caution with potential side effects (a sibling of mine had a very nasty immediate reaction to the vaccine). We will be careful otherwise and, knowing Covid in infants is largely uneventful, will deal with it if it comes. I have a parent who is a pharmacist and they’ve also advised against doing the Covid vaccine for our little one given its short period of time in research for infants. Again, totally acknowledge there are pros and cons of each side
0/0/0/1	Also went Novavax, also had way less side effects. Whoa if you think mrna is bad wait for shingles vaccine. It was my worst Moderna reaction x3 at least.
1/1	Also, we have a vaccine for Covid, like we have for viruses in the past like Polio, smallpox, etc. Covid is not being used to rule the world. People are losing it.
1/1	Although previous evidence has shown that exposure to and belief in vaccine misinformation significantly affects vaccine hesitancy and uptake, the current study’s data only show correlational relationships between these variables.
0/-1	Always cool and happy wants to blood donation daily is a oxygen like eating drinking latrine toilet etc to live enjoyable life around the world is called life breathing
0/0	Always remember that Congress mandated the shot for you to get it, but voted to exempt themselves from having to take it. What does that tell you?
0/0	Am 67 years old and my husband is 76 years old we both refused the jab . No to vaccine , we saw friends that was healthy and suddenly die coz of myocarditis … after having the vaccine
1/1	Am I the only person who still get my Covid vaccine every year?
1/0	Am Pfizer fully vaccinated
1/1	Am first in line for this vaccin
1/1	Am glad the assessment is going well. I like how you are impacting confidence in the people. I like how Media houses are working hand in hand to promote the livelihood of our human nature. Thank you so much
0	Am in South Africa since I took this covid 19 vaccine my eyes become problem since now no diognos it's been 2 Years up side down visiting doctors and specialist but nothing getting worse I even leave my job bcs I have to see docters everyweek and I can't see properly now please help
0/0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
0/0	Am vaccine free and glad i didnt comply. Feel bad for those who did.
1/-1	Amazing that we're getting to the point of dictating instructions to the cells
1/1	Amazing. Happy to see how far we have come. We urgently need a vaccine!!
1/-1	AmberAmber Finally someone who talks some sense. There are so many conspiratory theories about this. People need unbiased and correct information because they have been scared by unknowing people.
0/-1	Amen to answer Benefits vs Risk. I personally feel we all have a different body system. I get a flu shot every yr. I'm 70yrs old & gone through the beginning stages of covid & booster shot. I got sick with that... Then I had a RSV shot in late September. I've been terribly sick with a cold and chest virus. I feel no more shots for me Drs
1/-1	Amen🙌 I couldn't have said it better than that!
1/0	Americans, enjoy your measles! It is coming back thanks to these antivaxxers.
0/0	An FDA advisor on the vaccine committee….right I’m sure there’s no bias or conflict of interests here
0/0	An alternative to the genocidal vaccine. He is determined to get you somehow. #Beware of #BillGates and his products.
1/1	An anti vaxxer dying of Covid is the equivalent of someone bragging about how they drink and drive all the time, then wrap themselves around a telephone pole going 110, or someone who keeps breaking into people’s homes and ends up getting shot.
0/0	An antivaxxer here.... Do not tell other folks what to put into their body..
1/1	An applause to everybody who contributed in making and giving out these wonderful stuff.
0/0	An esteemed cardiologist in Canada died after having the booster just recently. Add him to the lists of death and injury that MSM won’t tell you about.
1/1	An example of a true statement is ‘With most COVID-19 vaccines, you will need 2 shots to get the most protection.
1/1/1	An important bit from the article: "Still, experts stress that vaccination is the preferable route to immunity, given the risks of Covid, particularly in unvaccinated people."
1/1	An insult to the family of the dead. Truly, no medicine for stupidity.
0/0	An italian dancer named Santo Giuliano had an heart attack from myocarditis two days after Pfizer vaccine. Luckily he is alive cause' he had it at the hospital and the doctors saved him! He already had Covid last year and he had recovered well but the vaccine had this effect on him..I don't understand why some people have zero or mild reactions and others so bad reactions..I know that we are all different but it's scary! I wish there was a way to know if you have a predisposition to some kind of reactions!
1/1/1/1	Anana Musme so your immune system worked. That's pretty much how a vaccine does it too. I had the vaccinations. I haven't had covid. I had the vaccinations I haven't had 'flu.....or smallpox or polio or any other of the diseases that vaccination can prevent.
1/0/1	Anaphylaxis: Severe allergic reaction that can occur in approximately 1 to 2 cases per million vaccine doses. Myocarditis or Pericarditis: Inflammation of the heart muscle or surrounding tissue, reported mainly after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, with rates around 2.13 cases per 100,000 vaccine recipients. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS): A rare neurological disorder that can occur with an incidence of about 1 case per 100,000 vaccinated individuals. Thrombosis: with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS): A rare condition involving blood clots and low platelet counts, associated particularly with Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine, estimated at 7 cases per million doses. Seizures: Generally reported after vaccinations, with an increased risk particularly among young children receiving multiple vaccines simultaneously. Intussusception: A type of bowel obstruction that can occur in 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 100,000 vaccinated infants post-rotavirus vaccination. Severe Rash or Skin Reactions: Some vaccines may cause serious skin reactions, occurring in under 1% of recipients. Acute Immune Thrombocytopenia: A rare condition characterized by low platelet count and bleeding, reported post-vaccination but at very low frequencies.
0/0	And ALL OF THEM give heart issues. Myocarditis
0/-1	And COVID wasn't dangerous until they shoved ventilators down peoples' throats and refused to provide antibiotics. What's your point?
1/0	And I lost friends who refused the vaccine and caught Covid and died. So there’s that.
0/0	And I'm glad I didnt get it. People have been dropping dead in record numbers since its came out.
1/-1	And I've talked to hundreds that have had zero, and not even one regrets their decision.
0	And I’ve never been the same since.
1/1	And THIS is why I love science and technology...
1/1	And a couple months ago an antivacc family came from the US, then another from France, and they're now quarantined because they are producing an outbreak.
0/0	And a friend of mine got cancer after Was fine before it 1 month later was sick
0/0	And adverse events are not rare. I know 3 people with vax injuries.
1/0	And all the thousands of pharmaceutical workers creating the vaccines voluntarily did this to their own families? Anyone who believes this BS is as big a nut case as Flynn. They used to have mental institutions for people like him.
1	And another good thing about SG is vaxx is not getting politicized. Every single minister/member of parliament, be it ruling or opposition party, is *pro vaxx*. Hence, the divide is getting smaller between pro and anti vaxx.
0/0	And by getting this vaccine you think things will go back to normal?????
0/0	And everyone was caling us Conspiracy theorists..
1/0	And here's how the work, they strategically kill the host so that the virus dies. GENIUS!!!
1/1	And i have no side effects. And im fully vaccinated what does it mean If you have vaccine but have no side effect
0/0	And if this virus is so deadly like the media portrays it is how come they need to test us for the virus and how come they need to convince us to take the vaccine and if this virus was so deadly we would see people dropping dead in supermarkets and on the streets
0/-1	And it gets worse and worse as time goes on. People are dying left and right and the media gas lights us all.
0/0	And just think, several years ago, we had many “honorary medical professionals” in society, Twitter, social media, work places pressuring others to comply with vaxx mandates… 🫠 🤮
0/0	And no unvaxxed person is surprised at all.....what a shock.
0/0/0	And now 2 years latter when the data unequivocally proves that the Covid vax is harmful the left says what? Oh they want more people to be “vaxed”. They always understood that it was harmful, they always intended harm
0/0	And now tell us how effective the vaccins are after 9 months. Here in the Netherlands we have the most cases since the start of the pandemic with a 86% vaccine rate..
0/0	And people here in China don’t even know about this! fake shit created by some media houses for cheap views World is wiser now after the fake corona darama
1/1	And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I declined an invite to a largish get-together this weekend. I'm in Virginia, where vaccination is high, but there are still a lot of anti vaxxers, and mutations, and too many questions.
0/0	And that’s genetic editing. This whole thing has been a global eugenics program. The humane genome has been edited and for who knows what. Enough people were injected to ensure the edited genetic lines continue to reproduce and eventually been dominant genetic traits
1/1	And the conspiracy morons are coming out of the woodwork. I think only legally mandated vaccine programs can bulldoze over these idiots and ensure public health. Education will take too long.
1/1	And the flu too! This is really cool, and I hope jt works. I will, however, be super annoyed that much like masks, this vaccine protects other people more than yourself. Thus we have to rely on our neighbors to take it when they get Covid to prevent them from spreading it to us. Will they? Many probably won’t, sadly.
0/-1	And the long-term effects of vaccines? Unknown...
0/0	And the unvaccinated for covid live long and happy without anny side effects

1/1	And then there's still antivaxxer who refuses to take the vaccine that took years and years of research smh
0/0	And then they paid hospitals to malpractice and call everything the virus instead of colds or the flu or a bug
0	And they (the un-vaxed) will be the ones least at risk of a sudden heart attack under stress. Less prone to having a stroke or the sudden onset of “turbo” cancer. The Military ends fit soldiers not vax damaged and mentally ill ones (i.e. narcissist trans perverts)
0/0	And they wanted to inject me with this crap and were saying it's completely safe? Glad i didn't buckle and refused it!
0/0	And we were conspiracy theorists for using common sense, and warning others who had no common sense

1/1	Anecdotally I haven’t had a cold in several years now. Maybe the masking , hand sanitizer and overall caution has made a bigger difference but the 5 covid shots may have helped at least for coronavirus colds
0/0	Animal studies are being skipped! I'm not having the vaccination. The last time I was vaccinated I got sick twice from respiratory illnesses. They are never tested on a significant number of elderly, Asian people anyway so I wouldn't know if it was safe with people like me.

1/1	Anti-vaccine idiots will be the death of us
1/1	Anti-vaccine parents are clearly in the wrong. Most doctors and scientists are in support of vaccinating children and clear research has been done to support the fact that they work. Plus, ever notice how pro-vaccine parents are never on social media trying to defend and advertise their point? Vaccinate your kids, parents. For their sake, yours, and the entire world really.
1/0	Anti-vaccine parents, your kids are protected by vaccinated kids. Imagine your kids go to a place where contagious diseases surrounding. What is your point of view then???
1/1	Anti-vaccine people love to learn the hard way until they can’t anymore.
1/0	Anti-vaccine: but they don't completely remove the risks, so why bother? Seatbelts don't prevent injury in all cases. Do these people refuse to wear seatbelts because they're not guaranteed to work, or do they realize some protection is better than none?

0/0	Any day now, the great die off is upon and only the free will survive and inhabit the planet
0/0	Any immunity they received should be immediately revoked. Lawsuits and prosecutions should begin. The FDA should also be held accountable for approving this garbage without proper testing.
1/1	Any opposition to the Covid vaccine is almost entirely political, and not at all based on science and medicine, since its actually safe.
0/0	Any parent that consents to having their children jabbed should be brought to justice and inprisoned, they’re just as evil as these pieces of shit

0/0	Anyone here who preached the vaccine and made it seem so amazing and innovative during covid should look around. If they got it and are suffering effects I wouldn't even burden myself with their issues because they did it to themselves when alot of people warned them. I don't have much sympathy for the people who acted really authoritative, holier than thou and comdemned people who didn't get it it.
0/-1	Anyone know if the new covid vaccines have the same side effects as the previous ones? All of them have made me sick to the point where I was laid up in bed for a day or so. I'm getting married in a month so being around a bunch of people and then traveling for the honeymoon it seems like a good idea to get the new vax but I'm not sure if I want to be sick right now. Then again maybe it's better off to be sick now vs sick later.
0/0	Anyone pushing this vaccine so hard is either brainwashed or getting paid. Period.
1/0	Anyone that refuses the vaccine should sign hospital waivers. The people that care about their families deserve a spot if needed.

0/-1	Apparently my tin foil hat kept me safe. Thank you inner tingling spider sense.

0/0	Are all side effects fully and accurately reported and recorded?
1/1	Are any of these people still alive? What the hell were they opposing? I took the shots. I wore the mask. What freedom did I lose? I saw people dying, mostly from not taking the shots. So what did this hope to accomplish? Seems dumb to me.

1/1	Arguing with an anti vaxxer is like playing chess with a pigeon. You may win the game but the pigeon will knock all the pieces off, poop on the chess board, and strut around like it won anyway.
1/1	Arguing with antivaxxers is like playing chess with a pigeon. It'll just kick over all the pieces and shit on everything, then it'll continue strutting around as if it won.
0/-1	Around 65% in children ages 9 months to 4 years in the first 2 months after vaccination. Protection decreased over time
1/1	Arthritis in your hands or no hands at all? I think I'll stick with vaccines
1/1	As COVID, flu, and RSV cases surge, staying updated on vaccinations is more critical than ever. Protecting ourselves and our communities through timely immunization can help reduce hospitalizations and ease the burden on healthcare facilities
1/1	As I am typing this I just got my first jab, literally waiting to be released. So pumped for my second one in a month.
1/1	As a "young person", I have been reluctant to get vaccinated because even though I have technically been eligible for a while, I didn't want to take the spot of someone who might need it more. Now that we're all eligible, in the US, I just scheduled mine and it's a huge relief! Get it if you can!!
1/1	As a 15 year old I honestly can’t wait to get vaccinated Sad I can’t yet
1	As a 19 year old, as soon as the vaccines were available in my country for my age group I made myself an appointment and I'm fully vaccinated since 2nd of April. I really want this to stop so I can rightly enjoy my student life.
0/0	As a 22+ years inpatient RN of many stripes, I'm SO happy to finally see more people waking up to how much we've been lied to in this pandemic. I knew things were corrupt before it, but I didn't know that the "corruption" is actually "capture". My eyes opened when I almost lost my career over refusing to take the jab; the mandate was SO shady to me with how little we knew at the time.
1/1	As a 26 year old living in the UK, all of you in the US need to know how privileged you are simply by having it available to you. I have to wait until June or July. And every other country has to wait even longer!
1/1	As a 27-year-old musician, I got my appointment within an hour of them going up this week, because I. WANT. TO. PLAY. SHOWS. AGAIN!!!
0/0	As a 76 year old man, I am glad I didn't take vaccines except polio and smallpox as a child. I have never had a flu vaccine, nor did I take the COVID vaccines. I had COVID and have not been really sick since COVID.
0/0	As a African my ancestors never needed man made medecine.Nature made herbs only
1/1	As a Canadian, I've given the government a lot of shit the last few months. That being said, we're vaccinating like crazy now and could reach 75% of the population 12+ vaccinated (first dose) within like three weeks.
1/-1	As a Pharma D I think it is one of the most simple and brilliant explanation I have spotted on Youtube!
1/1	As a Pharmacist who worked in the field of research for years, yes I will take this vaccine as soon as it's available.
1/-1	As a Respiratory Therapist with over 40 years experience this is one of the most misunderstood things about vaccines. I can't even begin to tell you how common it is for a patient to tell me they won't take the Flu vaccine because they think they always get the flu after they get the shot so what's the point, granted I'm hearing this in then ER where they have presented with the actual Flu. This needs to be aggressively explained prior to injection.
1/1	As a anti vaccinator that received this vaccination today. I needed this. It may feel good about getting this.
1/-1	As a care worker I had the vaccine and I m fine. But I will admit I was also worried about it.
0/0/-1	As a dental hygienist and taking the vaccine to “prevent the spread” to patients was totally worth the severe nerve damage in my hands and feet for last two years, making it impossible for me to work as a DH.

1/1	As a former community Nurse from a 3rd world country, I can't express enough how important vaccines are. When the people back home started fearing vaccines it put the country backwards. If it wasn't for covid, people won't go back to believing in vaccines again. And it is very dangerous. People from Western countries are so lucky to have the means to healthcare and vaccines. And most just don't think of their privilege.

1/1	As a former nurse snd now public health/ preventive medicine doctor i find the vaccine effective
1/1	As a gambling man, with over 30 nasal vaccines in the clinical trial pipeline, I’m betting that it will exist and be effective. But as a gambling man I know nothing is certain. For my family, even if I’m not allowed to take it every two months, I will anyway.
1/1	As a geneticist, videos like these make me happy. Accurate, informative, and will hopefully ease some people's fears. Nicely done yet again!
1/1	As a healthcare worker, I’ve seen firsthand what this virus can do. The vaccine is safe.
1/1	As a healthcare worker, this is the first time I’ve heard anyone say they would get a vaccine to help me and it made me feel more things than I though it would. Thank you Hank.
1/1	As a law student I timed my first dose so that I would get my second dose right after my last final. I think we will see an uptick of young people getting vaccinated in late may and early June because students are worried about feeling sick during finals.
1/1	As a medical worker recently got my second Pfizer doze. I had tough day with fever, chills and head, joint pain. But I am really happy to live in these exceptional times and to be witness and participant of the science. Hope this pandemic will end soon and leave less antivaxxers
0/1	As a nurse working at an infectious disease ward: of the many patients I’ve met who were vaccinated and still got COVID, the large majority of them had a mild version of it.
0/0	As a nurse, I knew they were bad. Unvaccinated for 15 yrs. Also a fired nurse because my company didn't honor my religious exemption. Haven't looked back. Retired now.
0/0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.

1/-1	As a scientist I don't want the emotional personal anecdotes, I want the data, the pie charts, the statistics, and the clinical trials.
1/1	As a youngster in the 50s, before we had vaccines for these, here is what I had to suffer through: measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox. My mother had polio. After the vaccines, no one had to go through those awful illnesses. Am I vaccinated today? You bet I am. I am so grateful . I have had the vaccines for polio, diphtheria, pertussis, pneumonia, hepatitis, Tetanus, shingles, COVID, HPV, and every year the flu vaccine.
1/-1	As an Asian American from a 1st gen. refugee family, its important that 1. The messengers are people who are from our own community and who speak our language, 2. Hospitals and healthcare acknowledge that trust needs to be built between them and us. Historically, my community doesnt trust doctors- especially our elders, 3. Offer financial incentives for getting vaccinated.
0/0	As an RN I was appalled at the gullibility of people who just ran to get one. It was created over 6 months!?!?!?!?!?!?! No trials, no nothing!!!!!! And THIS is why there are trial periods. Lasting years if not decades before being made available to the public. I never took it and I would never advise anyone take it.
1/1	As an immune compromised person myself as well as a spouse of one and mother of two-we all appreciate you!
0/0	As an unVaxed person l feel bad for the people that were feared into taking the poison
0/0	As an unvaccinated health worker who almost lost their job because of the mandates I can truthfully say not a day goes by when I am not immensely grateful and relieved I did not succumb to pressure and take the shots.
1/1	As annual flu jabs are freely available at my workplace, I have been getting flu jabs every year. So far, I haven't got bad flu for a long time.
1/1	As does the Old Study.... I had 4 shots at the Height of COVID, not one single fucking reaction. Just got the booster and the flu shot the same day last Friday for work. Still Standing...unlike the Unvaccinated afflicted with COVID.
1/0	As far as I'm concerned all the other stuff is fine, but this one vaccine can't slide.
1/1	As fewer people are getting vaccinated the people that want to get new vaccines will suffer as the company scraps research and development of new vaccines
1/1	As for breakthrough cases, being vaccinated reduces the severity of disease against covid significantly. If you catch it and are unvaccinated, your chance of hospitalisation/death goes WAY UP.
0/0	As it should be.. fuckin Covid vaxx.. that's why i never had a single dose.. that vaccines are just pure bullshit
0/0	As long as humans keep watching fake news and getting a fake injection that is not even a real vacc you will risk your life.

Give them all your hard-earned money so they could keep doing it over and over! FACT!

1/1	As long as it’s free I’m planning on getting it

1/-1	As long as we get the elderly and most vulnerable, along with the health care workers and other essential employees, I think we’ll be doing well. That should dramatically reduce the number of deaths. Then start working on everyone else and that should cut down transmission to a point where we can return to near normal
1/1	As move on to the next phase of the pandemic it is time that the world deserves safe and effective vaccines like Covaxin.
1/1	As of today, I got my first vaccine against the pandemic. And no, I have no regrets of getting it at all.

1/1	As someone that had chickenpox twice. Once as a kid and second time in my twentys. I wish i had rhe vaccine. Second time i got internal chicken pox. And now over 10 years later i still have side effects from it.
1/1	As someone who for medical reasons cannot get vaccinated, PLEASE get vaccinated if you can. It really DOES save lives
1/1	As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it.
1/1	As someone who has gotten their vaccine, the relief and the anxiety that was eliminated after the vaccine supersedes any fear or inconvenience from side effects and scheduling
1/1	As someone who has taken graduate level immunology, I find it disheartening to see this comments section rife with misinformation. Vaccinations are essential for a large, healthy population. Those against vaccinations are experiencing the luxury of herd immunity from those who have vaccinations. The additives in vaccines are often used to inactivate or preserve the vaccinations with upmost efficiency. Some vaccines do have risks; however, the pros of vaccinating far outweigh the cons of not doing so.
0/0	As someone who hasn’t had ANY covid jabs I can say it’s been very strange. I’ve never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven’t caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren’t saying anything now.
1/1	As someone who lives in Brazil (with a comorbidity), the fact that you have to beg people to get vaccines in the US is mind blowing to me. I have no idea when I'll be able to leave the house to walk my dog once a day without having a panic attack.
1/1	As someone who nearly died early in the pandemic. I would openly challenge anyone who says "The vaccine is worse than the disease"
1/1	As someone who was born with autism and mild ADHD I find it very offensive when people refer to autism as a disease. I do not notice anything wrong with having autism. It is not something you can contract like covid, you are either born with it or do not have it. There is overwhelming evidence that proves vaccines do not cause autism. Even despite the evidence, the potato-brained antivaxxers refuse to use common sense and continue to spread misinformation. I swear if even one more person calls my condition a disease I will go absolutely ballistic
1/1	As someone with "long COVID" but from a different viral infection, legitimately any amount of protection is worth it.
1/1	As someone with a neurological condition that prevents me from getting viral vector vaccines, the covid vaccines are a godsend. mRNA is a beautiful technology.
1/1	As someone with asthma, getting the vaccine gives me peace of mind. Grateful for modern medicine.
1/1/1	As soon as I can get it, I'm getting it.
1/1	As soon as I can. I can't afford to die/get severe complications from Covid-19. I am 51 and I need it! 2 friends have several severe complications from having it.
1/1	As soon as I was 18 I moved out and got vaccinated - and I believe it's the right choice!
0/0	As soon as they started forcing vaccination, I understood something was wrong
1/1	As soon as we were eligible for it, we got it. My husband and youngest son, and my son who is in the Navy We have about another week to reach the full efficacy of the vaccine.
1/0	As the only unvaxed member of my family I am the only one to have only caught covid once.
1/1	As vaccination coverage expands, the pandemic situation is clearly improving, and people’s mobility is returning to normal.

0/0	At 08:14 the truth about vaccines is outed. FFS, how is something that supposedly will HELP people live longer produce what he's suggesting (15% reduction in world population.) wow.
1/1	At first I was a bit skeptical about it but I don’t care anymore. I just want to get out and work. So I’ll get it and whatever happens, happens. A lot of things that we consume daily can cause illnesses, so I’ll take the risk with this. I’m at the bottom of the list tho. So I won’t be eligible for the vaccine anytime soon. Petrified of needles, so getting it should be interesting since we need 2 doses
1/1	At first people were blaming science now the only thing you can blame is yourself
1/1	At first, I was hesitant because the vaccine was developed so quickly. But after seeing millions of people get vaccinated with only minor or no side effects, I decided to get vaccinated myself.
1/1	At first, I wasn’t sure about getting the vaccine, but after seeing so many friends and family members get it without issues, I felt more confident. I ended up getting vaccinated, and I’m grateful I did. It not only protects me from severe illness, but it also helps keep my community safe. It’s a small step that makes a big difference
1/1	At least there is the light at the end of tunnel.
0/0	At least they are smart coincidentally they don't get rabies outbreaks either which deems to be amping up in the states here from stupidity.
0	At no time in history has the people forcing others into compliance been the good guys.
0/0	At risk people will get sicker with any virus...does not need to be covid, the number of vaccine damaged people is much higher. nobody seems to be following that number as well as what this video is following and that fact is troubling. maybe i will find a video now that some time has passed and the truth is coming out.
1/1	At some point Darwin's theory has to take its course. If someone does not want to get vaccinated let them roll the dice! It's their choice. We're terribly overpopulated anyway.
1/-1	At the end of the day, there's just no cure for Stupid!
1/-1	At the end of the survey, we provided a comprehensive fact sheet about the COVID-19 vaccines.

0/0	At this point, I've lost all trust in the "experts". Even if every jab was a "kill shot", they'd still be chanting 'safe and effective'…
1/1	At this point, if you’re not vaccinated, you’re just making life harder for everyone else. 🤦
1/1	At this point, if you’re unvaccinated, that’s a personal choice. But don’t spread misinformation
1/1	At this point, there are plenty of vaccines to go around, to anyone who wants one. Almost every COVID-19 death in the US from this point on is an entirely preventable tragedy.
1/1	At what point do we isolate these anti-vaccine people? Honestly, you can't reach them with data or compassion or understanding. They are scientifically illiterate and dangerous to the public

0/0	Attention CDC. You're not supposed to cause panic for another a few days. The election is not over yet.
0/0/0	Attention all vaccine fanatics!People rush to get flu shots, only to end up getting the flu or injured by the shot, or getting a worse case of the flu the next year due to the flu shot. Now theyre practically standing in line to get a Covid vaccine, which is rushed to market, untested for safety or efficacy, contains human abortion cells, and strains of Covid that are morphing as you read this, rendering the vaccine worthless and dangerous to boot. Vaccines are the most dangerous form of medicine, but most people think theyre 100 percent safe and effective because thats all the media and CDC keep repeating, over and over.
0/0	Autism link was covered up - same will happen with COVID shots
0/0/0	Autism rates will skyrocket in 5 years from these mRNA experiments
1/1/1	Autistic person here- I just gotta say that the fact that parents would rather their child/children suffer and/or die from a preventable illness than have autism is very sad. Vaccines don't cause autism, but these people believe they do, and they still choose preventable illness. Autism is not a horrible thing, autistic people are just as valuable and worthy as any other human. I know this video is old, but it's still very relavant and the misinformation surrounding both vaccines and autism is terrifying.
0/1	Avoid getting tested and definately avoid getting 'vaccinated'.
0/0	Avoid the inoculation. They can destroy your bodies! Vaccines are a scheme which attempts to collapse the human being of Illuminati !
1/1	Avoiding all vaccines because of one bad reaction is like avoiding all fruit because you’re allergic to apples.

0/0	Bcuz they’re money making schemes. The covid shot isn’t a vaxx, it’s a bio weapon. They even changed the definition of a vaccine. This current Administration are just high profile serial killers.
1/1	Be a less risky way to protect yourself compared to getting sick with the virus that causes COVID-19
1/1	Be patient and just try to educate others. Ask them to consult their doctor or research credible sourced medical articles. I got my doses as soon as I could and I understand it's frustrating when everyone else isn't on board
0/0	Be very careful people. The rate of survival is 99% so I'll take my chances. I've lived through the flu without a shot and will do the same with this.
1/-1	Bearing that in mind, you, as someone who is unvaccinated, you will have to accept the consequences of your choice
0	Because I learned how poorly they're tested. Almost always they don't use a real placebo. And they don't log AEs for an adequate period.

0/0	Because of that damn Covid vaccine jab, I've ended up with type 1 diabetes, and now I don't trust the government at all. So yeah, I'm a conspiracy theorist.
1/1	Because of the vaccine, I was able to attend my best friend’s wedding in person instead of over a screen. I’m so thankful for this scientific breakthrough!
0/-1	Because of this there will be blood in the streets MARK MY WORDS
0/0	Because they'll put whatever it takes in the vaccines. Look how well the Covid vaccine worked, why bother calling something a vaccine that doesn't prevent it. How many have to die from them to realize what it is they are doing? Now forcing cattle producers to use mRNA vax..
0/0	Because they’ve had them planned for years
1/1	Because vaccines very obviously work. They've been in use for centuries and there's copious scientific evidence that they're very effective.
1/1	Becoming a parent doesn’t grant you a medical degree or make you a therapist. You’re well-intentioned but to say that you know what will or won’t hurt your child from a medical standpoint better than someone who has spent their life studying medicine…no, you don’t. Respectfully, you don’t.

1/1	Been vaccinated and had a few boosters. Haven't gotten COVID once since it showed up and I have yet to experience any of these mutant powers I was promised by the people who lambasted me for getting the vaccine
1/1	Before any of these vaccines were available and they started listing the names of all of the different types I saw the name 'Moderna' and just knew that was the one I wanted. I liked the name and it sounded the best so that's the one I set out to get and that's the very first vaccine offered to me. I'm glad I got Moderna it appears to be the absolute best at this time. (It's 92% effective after 6 months where as Pfizer goes down to 84%).
0/0	Before getting vaccinated, I almost never caught a cold. Now? I'm constantly sick.
1/1	Before the anti-vaxxer freaks chime in I should add that if the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine reaches room temperature and you are injected with it the worst that can happen is: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!! It’d be like getting an injection of saline. Nothing would happen. So my preference for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is that it’s simply more likely to remain potent. The side-effect of getting a Moderna or Pfizer vaccine which had reached room temperature would only be remaining susceptible to COVID-19.
1/1	Before when a vaccine came out, everyone was vaccinated without problems, now it's a mess because people don't trust anyone anymore.
1/-1	Before: Here is your vaccine 💉 “perfect thank you” Now: here is your vaccine 💉 “ oh where is it from what is the efficency which kind of tech and vaccine is it? Are you a doctor”

1/1	Being anti-vax isn’t edgy, it’s embarrassing.
0/0	Being fired for not taking a vaccine was an absolute disgrace.
1/1	Being fully vaccinated reduces your risk of hospitalization from COVID to a very low risk.
1/1	Being only 17, the main reason for which I chose to get vaccinated wasn’t to protect myself, but to protect those around me. I got vaccinated in order to see my grandparents, my relatives and friends again, without the pressure of the mask and the stress of getting infected.
1/1	Being vaccinated allowed me to keep my job and continue supporting my family.
1/1	Being vaccinated does not make you immune to COVID, but it prevents you (in case you get infected) from having more serious symptoms, or even dying.
1/1	Being vaccinated gave me peace of mind during the pandemic.
1/1	Being vaccinated gave me the confidence to go back to work safely.
1/1	Being vaccinated helps reduce the spread of the virus.
1/1	Being vaccinated isn't a position of pride. It is simply logic. When I was potty trained I know as an adult I didn't deserve a Nobel prize in not shitting my Huggies Diapers. But anti vax'ers should be ashamed that they cant grasp simple logic.
1/1	Being vaccinated lets me travel, work, and see my friends without constant worry.
1/1	Being vaccinated means fewer disruptions to daily life.
1/1	Being vaccinated with vaccines authorized by the competent authorities is an act of love. And contributing to ensure the majority of people are vaccinated is an act of love.

And even if it does not kill you, contracting COVID, even a mild case, can cause some serious and perhaps permanent issues.
1/1	Both Moderna and Pfizer, whose vaccines use an mRNA platform, found their vaccines to be about 95% effective. The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine showed a somewhat lower efficacy, but is less expensive and poses fewer issues involved in distribution and administration.

0/1	By preventing disease, vaccines reduce healthcare costs related to medical treatments, hospitalizations, and long-term care for chronic conditions that can result from infectious diseases
1/1	By reducing the severity and spread of the virus, vaccines help protect the broader community, especially those who are most vulnerable or cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. So, while the term “anti-vax” might seem moot if you’re only considering absolute immunity, the protection offered by vaccines is still incredibly valuable and effective in managing the pandemic.

Many thousands of people (guinea pigs) died from the "vaccine". Corona virus has been around thousands of years, just like many viruses. I'm a nurse. I did not take the shot.

1/1	Caught covid for the first time this month and as an immunocompromised person it was scary. Luckily I was able to get Paxlovid which is a medication given to those at a high risk of developing severe illness and makes it so covid can’t replicate inside your body. If it wasn’t for the medication I would have ended up in the hospital even though I’m fully vaccinated. After being so sick even with medication and vaccines it makes everything I went through in the beginning of the pandemic worth it. I didn’t leave my house for months only having contact with my immediate family I suffered extreme depression and isolation I missed my high school graduation and I lost friends over them not taking things seriously. But had I caught covid before I was vaccinated before medications were available and while the healthcare system was at the brink of collapse I without a doubt would have died. It’s good to know that everything I sacrificed saved me Read more Like 54 Dislike Reply

1/1	Concerning your distrust of government, you don't need to trust the government; trust the doctors behind it. If they back it, it's probably one of the things the government did right! Lack of FDA approval doesn't necessarily mean it's harmful. It means it hasn't passed under a medical regulatory system which was NOT designed to deal with a crisis like, say, a global pandemic. And as with anything with the government, it's an unnecessarily slow process, and time is money, or in this case lives. The fact it's unconventional? It's just relatively new technology. It's been looked into for decades, just not applied on a large scale until now (and so never caught the layman's eye; but the experts knew). Think of it like when the first jet engines came into WW2 planes.

We’re starting to see a few breakthrough infections, but none of them severe.

He scared them by saying the vaccine could sterilize them, give them cancer, and have severe unknown problems that will appear in 10 years. They got Covid a month ago, and now their doctor is saying that getting the vaccine will ruin their natural immunity. (They made sure to find a hospital that gave them the IV antibody infusion, however)
0/0	Dear Drs, I personally have followed this exact thing for the last 19 years and listen to countless stories of adverse reactions .I would really appreciate more scientific unbiased studies done because not enough is done to prove parents wrong ! They know what they witnessed and sad that their stories fall on deaf ears. I urge you to try and fight for our children to make vaccines safer .

These kids today are getting 72 and they are absolutely falling apart. I’ve never seen young people with so many chronic illnesses and strange ailments. It’s not normal, something is causing it. And 72 injections of aluminum, formaldehyde and other neurotoxins can’t be helping. And we aren’t dealing with trace amounts when there’s 72 of them. They also were not studied in combination the way they are administering them with a bunch at once. Why would you give your kids this many vaccines that you yourself didn’t even take??? It’s child abuse. They are kids, not a medical experiment!

0/0	Effective? LOL
1/1	Effectiveness in *early* studies shows it drops, but it is still far more effective than we could have even hoped for. So...get the vaccine. The fewer people infected, the fewer times the virus replicates, which decreases chance of more variants.
0/0	Either the clock is ticking against you or you got a placebo. Time will tell.
1/1	Emotion is an important aspect to incentivize research. But we need to understand when it clouds our judgment. This doctor of course needs to protest that vaccinations need to be tested thoroughly but also needs to understand that a freak accident isnt the norm
1/1	End racism. Get your new covid booster today
0/0	Enjoy your "Side effects" lol. Take more boosters
1/1	Especially for middle-aged and elderly people, it's essential to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
1/1	Essential oils are not a replacement for medicine.
1/1	Essentially if you're worried about the vaccine but not worried about the virus... you basically have your risk assessment back to front. The virus WILL do far more harm to your body than the mRNA vaccine ever could. That's why we develop vaccines in the first place. They're specifically designed to be safe. The mRNA vaccines also have FEWER preservative ingredients so the chances of an allergic reaction are also reduced (this is why they have to be stored at cold temperatures because it doesn't include superfluous stuff needed to keep a viral capsid alive.) Btw I got my moderna jab 3 days ago. Quick and painless. They keep you around for like 15 minutes after your jab to monitor you and ensure you don't go into an allergic shock just as a precaution. So you're in safe hands. And my side-effects fortunately were just a sore arm (feels like someone punched my arm and bruised my muscle.) I didn't get a fever or a headache fortunately neither did anyone in my family (but everyone reacts differently so if you do get a fever or headache don't worry that's normal.) You don't want to get infected. On an individual level you are gonna be damaged more by the virus far more than any vaccine. And on a collective level by becoming infected you are essentially volunteering yourself as a petri dish for the virus to undergo potential evolution and develop into new variants. The more and more people who get infected the more chance there is of the virus evolving such that it no longer is effected by our vaccines. Now I doubt this will happen (our vaccines seem effective against all variants) but there's a slim chance all the same... so if you have a bit of civic duty running through your veins definitely get yourself vaccinated to protect others around you both in the short-term and in the long-term battle globally. The pandemic isn't over for anyone until its over for everyone.
1/1	Even I had some qualms about the efficacy given the shortened timelines, but I never worried about the safety of the vaccines because... well, vaccines are an extremely safe category of medicine.

1/1	Even if Vaccines causes autism its a non argument in my opinion, like whats worse a child with a condition, or a dead child? Like im autistic and i know several autists, we are very normal people. We can have jobs,families and social relationship, like the more you get to know autism and autistic people you quckily learn how little it can matter if the person is given a space to retreat and given some basic sympathy. In short, even if vaccines causes autism. Id rather have a safe healthy child than a dead one.
1/1	Even if infected, the COVID-19 vaccine helps reduce symptoms and prevents severe illness and death.

1/1	Every prescription has potential side effects.
1/1	Every shot gets us closer to ending this crisis.
0/0	Every single acre should be taken back by the people. Gates poisons our food and creates other poisons to kills us that he calls vaccines.
0/1	Every source I've seen that casts doubt on the safety or efficacy of the Covid vaccine goes right back to right-wing politics.
1/1/1/1	Every time I get a tetanus shot, I get really bad aches and a fever for a couple days, but I still get one every 10 years because I'm not an idiot. I'll take the crappy couple days for something that could save my life
0/0	Every time I had a vaccine I was very sick, since I stopped having any vaccines I feel very well so I don't think I will do it.
1/1	Every time someone dies the sicko antivaxers always put their agenda on the death. Bruv, let these people grieve without your BS
0/0	Every time they mention one of the vaccines shouldn’t they also list all the known side effects too?
1/1	Every vaccine dose brings us one step closer to a safer.
1/1	Every vaccine dose is a step toward a healthier society
1/0/1	Every vaccine had skepticism at first. This is nothing new.
1/1/1/1	Every year. I recently had it so I'm waiting for another month or so to get the next shot.
1/1	Everybody in my age group received all of our vaccines and all of our boosters and none of us became autistic. I am also having my coronavirus vaccine and the booster. I ended up with a genius IQ as did a few of my friends but the vaccines did not harm us in any way!
1/-1	Everybody is hung up on whether vaccines actually "stopped" "infection" or "transmission" or "prevented" "hospitalization or "death". The data on those things is not important. Its about how the vaccines changed feelings. The vax made me feel safe from infection b4 I got infected
1/-1	Everybody should do its part!!!

0/0	Everyone I know who got that is sick. Can't sue for it.. Hope it was worth a free slurpy. Plant medicine ONLY!
0/0	Everyone I know who has taken it , meaning about 6-8 people. all are on anxiety medication now after taking the covid jab.... When you do your own research into what was in them, you find many disturbing things, but for starters, graphene oxide was the most abundant poison .. Also a variety of parasites and parasite eggs... So for starters, researching on how to remove the graphene from the body....And just as importin, starting a parasite cleanse to clear out the parasites... The over abundance of these parasites cause a verity of issues including headaches and brain fog.... The vaccine was the "bug" that then was "shed" or spread around the globe in the form of a modified parasite.... Parasite eggs spread very easily.....This explains why people were beating the covid with the horse deformer.... Good luck...
0/0	Everyone I know who was vaxxed have changed in personality over the last few years and their health has declined rapidly. Both of my parents were vaxxed and they went from very healthy older ppl to barely able to function at all over the last four years. One is developing dementia, both can now barely walk. One is on the verge of alzheimers. They argue constantly. One is always crying and emotional now. Both have become very aggressive. They weren't this way four yrs ago. Other ppl I know have developed mental health conditions, three ppl I know have had strokes and they're just in their 30s to 50s. Some somehow got hiv and are medicated for hiv now. Many ppl I know had heart attacks and died. Others have just become very sickly in general. I am unvaxxed and I am doing the same as before with no problems but the vaxxed ppl are falling apart.. Many have become very aggressive too.

0/0	Exactly how does me being vaccinated protect others when the vaccine does not prevent spread or infection?
0/0	Exactly! As soon as they started forcing vaccination, I understood something was wrong, just didn´t know exactly what... Later on, I got pissed off the more propaganda and the more violation of human rights was going on. I never understand people who didn´t realise a thing, but stretched their arms as though nothing important.
0/0/0	Exactly, made my decision so much easier when they started their coercion campaign.
0/0/0	Exactly. Its mRNA therapy, not a vaccine.
1/1	Excellent news, can’t wait to get the vaccine!
1/1/1	Excellent video, shows just how hard they all worked to develop a vaccine and care for the people who got Covid. Singapore is a wonderful place, it holds a position in my heart only equalled by HK. Wonderful food and friendly people. I worked there as an ex pat for Singtel for two years.
1/1	Excellent video. Another point to be made is how effective mRNA vaccines have been from the get go. Imagine where we might be now if they had only been say 30 effective.
1/1	Except a COVID-19 vaccine isn't a poison dart. What a stupid comparison.
1/1	Except for fatigue and arm soreness I had no reactions either time.
0	Except that the "pandemic" absolutely relied upon and intentionally pushed faulty test, known to have led to perceived epidemics in the past, with the flu all but magically disappearing in order to push the population towards these "vaccines". The "virus" never touched me, nor my wife, nor either of my parents - even though none of us are "vaccinated" and none of us treated the "pandemic" seriously...despite being told, on multiple times, that everyone would get "infected". In fact, my parents' doctor warned them that if they get infected in their unvaccinated state, they will die. Nevertheless, we are surrounded with vaccinated friends who have been dropping dead with aggressive cancer, strokes, heart attacks, etc. And yet we lost not one of our unvaccinated friends. The virus, if it even exists, is no more deadly than the flu.

1/1	Finally, truth always show in proof , as medical field , inactivated vaccine is the safest vaccine in the world right now
1/1	Findings across these studies suggest exposure to misinformation and believing it as true could increase vaccine hesitancy and reduce behavioral intention to get vaccinated.
1/-1	Findings can shed light on designing an effective social action campaign for decreasing the public’s vaccine hesitancy, increasing their health information literacy, and buttressing their ability to identify, resist, and refute false claims encountered in-person or online.
1/1	Findings of our study still raised some concerns about the prospect of overcoming vaccine misinformation and hesitancy.

0/0	First it was a single shot, then it was two, now it's a third. How many more shots do we need???
0/0	First of all herd immunity doesn't require vaccinations to take place. Second, these "vaccines" (I use the term loosely) have not even remotely been proven to be safe. And third, the "measure" for efficacy of these injections was based upon a very subjective "reduction in severe symptoms". Immunity, infection or transmission were not even factors in "proving" the efficacy of these experimental drugs.
1/0/1/1/0/0/0/1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
1/0	First time last year felt like I had a mild flu for a day. This time it hit me the next day and I was sluggish for a couple of days. But overall still 100% better than Pfizer which really did a number on me.
0/0	First year in a while I am passing up on the flu vax. Call it paranoid but I don’t trust the fed enough to safely say they didn’t put the vax in with the flu shot. I’m good. Guess I’m playing roulette this year, even with the flu shot simply being roulette itself.
1/1	First, I think the word “celebrity” is being used loosely in this case. So, the opinions of these people should really mean nothing to the rest of us, they obviously haven’t read any of the Science based facts concerning these vaccines. Ignorant people such as these are the reason this Pandemic is still ongoing and the variant is mutating. Not only are the ignorant they are selfish. Please, get vaccinated and protect the innocent that can’t!
0/0	First, it was one shot, then two, now boosters every few months? This is ridiculous.
0/0	First, they said it was optional, now they’re making it mandatory? Feels shady to me.
0/0	First, they said one shot, then two, then boosters... when does it end? I'm not signing up for a lifetime subscription. 🚫
0/0	First, they said one shot. Then two. Now boosters forever tiredddddd of these
1/1	First, vaccines do not guarantee you won't get a disease it protects against. They do though reduce your chances of contacting the disease. Second, the COVID vaccines you received were for the original strain. Many mutations have occurred since then which have reduced the effectiveness. Just like the flu. Third, we know from clear evidence and studies that the vaccines are significantly reducing the severity of illness if you do contract COVID after vaccination.
0/0	First, what constitutes “rare”? One in a million? One in a thousand? There are an awful lot of people suffering out there and when they ask if it was the vaccine, everyone is told no. That can’t be right.
0/0	Fk the vaccines! The body can do this more efficiently! And I don’t buy the part that it doesn’t affect your dna, there’s proof that it does.

0/0	Florida is the home of book bans, vaccine bans, science bans, history bans, and more on the way. If nothing else, let the state be a warning to the rest of us.
1/1	Folks the thing is…the vaccine is good. It’s a terrific development that really does turn a pandemic that kills 600k vulnerable into functionally a low level issue akin to the annual flu. It’s not going to turn you into a freak, kill you, make you go sterile or whatever
0/0	Follow the money! Who is profiting off them? 💰 🤑 💸 💲 🪙 💶 💰 🤑
0/0	Follow the money, unless it points to pharmaceutical companies with immunity from liability.

1/-1	Following an imperfect plan perfectly is always better than following no plan at all.
0/0/1/0	For a vaccine that they claim safe, effective and well studied they shore keep on coming up with a lot new aftereffects
1/1	For adults ages 18 and older, the 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines reduced the risk of critical illness from COVID-19 by almost 70% in the first 2 months after vaccination
0/0	For all the people suffering covid vaccine damages. Good luck finding a Dr that will admit that your damages are from the vaccine. Hopefully you'll find an honest Dr.
1/1	For all the people who cannot be vaccinated - I know how hard it is to keep seeing good advice to which you are the exception that proves the rule. For the rest of us, make no assumptions about people who are not vaccinated without further information, please. That said, for most of us - it is truly the best plan given the situation and information at this time. It's even free!
1/1/1	For anyone who’s pro-vax here... Great! You have a brain like I do!
1/1/1/1	For me personally I'd be far more convinced by a person who presents data than a person who presents personal anecdotes.
1/1	For me personally I'd be far more convinced by a professional who presents data than an antivaxxer who presents personal anecdotes.
1/1	For me, being a college student, the benefits far outweigh the risk. I love your videos, and thank you for keeping us all informed about this new type of vaccine.
1/1	For me, it was still worth it to get vaccinated. Covid-19 isn't going away.
0/0/0	For now maybe. You have no clue what the long term effects of this vaccine are. Nobody does.
1/1	For people with issues with side effects. Novavax has better efficacy and less side effects. Let's not forget vaccines make us shed less virus making us less contagious and that's a huge benefit for our medically fragile and complex patients who I still mask for.
1/1	For reference, there's a ~0.1% chance of you dying from being hit by a car, so this is a remarkable success from the scientists behind these vaccines
0/0	For some reason it doesnt feel right to take this…

1/1	Four doses of vaccine didn’t prevent me from getting COVID-19 but they did keep me out of the hospital and helped me recover quickly with no ill effects (that I know of). It’s worth it to mask and stay up to date with shots to protect yourself — and others.

0/0	Frequent vaccination, which makes people tired and causes many people to give up vaccination.
1/1/1	Friends around me say the vaccine is very safe, so there’s no need to worry too much about the risks.
1/-1	From Dr. Offit's Wash Post Op/Ed 11-29-2021: And since the boosters have potential side effects, however rare, it’s important to direct them to the people who will gain a clear benefit. A healthy young person with two mRNA vaccine doses is extremely unlikely to be hospitalized with covid, so the case for risking any side effects — such as myocarditis — diminishes substantially. Also, attempts to maintain protection of 90 percent or more against even mild disease among healthy people could lead to
0/0	From the vaccine consent form: " I understand that the long-term side effects or complications of this vaccine are not known at this time."
0/0/0	From what I hear and read, it’s the vaccinated being hospitalized
0/0/1/1	From your link The traditional protein vaccine (Novavax) cannot be updated as quickly, so it had to go with the older subvariant version. Novavax’s data suggest that this is probably okay, as even this older variant version gave good responses against current variants. For some (including me!), the side effects of mRNA vaccines can be intense. I’ll be getting Novavax for this reason.

0/0	Gates knows the vaccines were not properly tested and by now knows there are devastating side effects that are not so rare, some only now becoming obvious and more frequent. Most importantly, they are not vaccines, they do not prevent or cure the disease.
1/-1	Germany, the UK, Denmark all have higher vaccination rates than the US. If anything the US is falling further behind other nations now that accelerate their immunisation programs. Sure there is anti-vaxx idiocy in most countries to some lesser extents than it is in the US. Main reason for the high 'hesitancy' in the US is because it is so politicised.

I struggle to care for myself and lost the ability to care for my wife and daughter. I contracted COVID at work. What I got in return was 20 days FMLA and a termination voice mail while I was on a hospital bed with tubes attached to my body. Millions of Americans share my same predicament. Stop playing roulette with your family and get vaccinated.

1/1	Given that this years Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, whose pioneering work helped create mRNA vaccines, I figured it would be a good time to share this chart from a while back. It shows estimated lived saved because of covid-vaccines (including non-mRNA vaccines). The red shows actual (excess) deaths due to the pandemic (in thousands per day), while the blue shows the additional deaths that would have occurred if vaccines had not been administered. Both are estimates, the former by me in a separate project, the latter by a team of scientists who used them to estimate the lives saved by vaccines [(“Global impact of the first year of covid-19 vaccination”, by O.J. Watson et al., The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 2022).](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext) Tools used: R, Illustrator.

1/1	Given the frequency of covid variants, vaccines are always one or two variants behind. Is it safe to assume that, in spite of the vaccines being behind, they still would provide some protection against recent variants?
0/0	Given what I’ve seen, I’m glad I never caved into the pressure to get the shots. I don’t take rushed medicines, especially ones that have potentially irreversible effects.

0/-1	God in Heaven! A healthy child is the last person to be concerned about being infected; and if they are, their immune systems are plenty strong enough to fight whatever is thrown at it. I had covid in 2020 and fought it off. I am in my late 50s and have heart disease but am blessed with a robust immune system. I would fear being given this jab, due to the heart issues. Leave those kids alone!

1/1	God when anti-vax kid turns 3: Your free trial to life has ended
1/1	God, fully agree. I’ve been holding off on getting vaxxed because I wanted to make sure the info I had on the vaccine was correct and stayed stable over time. I also didn’t have money for a vaccine. Now that I know it’s free, I’m getting it.
1/1	Going Thursday for mine
1/1	Going today as soon as I'm off work! I'm excited, a bit nervous, but more than anything grateful to take my covid shot❤

1/1	Good medicine! After taking it!!!! MY body begin to feel comfortable!!!!
0/0/1	Good news! Those of you who’ve already gotten this vaccine, how do the side effects compare to previous doses? The last two boosters had me down flat for a day then weak for a few days after so I’m trying to time this booster with when I can afford to be somewhat out of it.
1/0	Good product don’t need to advertise over and over
1/1	Good thing I got my Booster Shot last week Tuesday because they recently just said there is a new variant discovered called Omicron.
0/0	Good thing I never got my first dose, and I never will!

1/1	Good to hear I got my first Pfizer today no health problems ever I hope I be ok
0/0	Good to see someone who has sense! Anyone who’s survived the last 4 years with the Covid “vaccine” knows it’s not safe and another Plandemic!

1/1	Good, last thing we need is more anti vaccine morons spreading their bullshit.
1/-1	Good, we're vaccinating for the "team"
1/1	Good. If people won't take a vaccine they can't have the same privileges. Sure it's their right but it's prolonging the virus.
0/1	Good. I’m from Tennessee and about 50% of the people I know are to some extent antivaxxers or Covid deniers.
0/0	Google is still very biased for the left. You can ask if Covid was created in a lab, which the CIA has confirmed it was, and you get nothing. But if you ask if the Vaccine prevents you from getting Covid, it tells you yes, which is complete BS.
1/1	Got AZ last week. So far everything is great. Had a sore arm for two days and a brief fever which lasted only 1 hour. I actually feel lucky to have some side effect symptoms as it means the vaccine is training my immune system.

1/1	Got both the new COVID/Flu vaccines, no regrets
1/1	Got both yesterday knowing I've never had side effects with either in the past. My arm is a bit sore and I'm very fatigued the next morning. But so far no icky feeling. I'm drinking coffee and will take ibuprofen soon.
1/1	Got covid and flu shots on the same day. I’m pregnant, so my physician recommended them.

0/0/0/0/0	Got covid, 4 day sinus pain, have never had a flu since, never took a jab.
0/0	Got fever few days later.......
0/0	Got fully vaccinated, I still got covid, Reason why a ton of people don't get vaccinated is because from our standpoint, it doesn't seem to work. We want a government we can trust, not be obliged to follow forcefully.
1/1	Got fully vaccinated. Then after a month I got covid hehe... Still thankful for being vaccinated. I have a lot of medical problems that are respiratory related in my previous years such as bronchitis and pneumonia. If I hadn’t gotten any vaccine, I may have had severe symptoms. Luckily I was just classified as asymptomatic when I got covid.
1/1	Got it for both my 3yo (at 2) and my 15.5 month old (at 8 months). Both babies are healthy and happy and I treat easy knowing that even if they get it, they will get a weaker case.
1/1	Got it once, after I'd been vacced. It was relatively mild and over quickly. Thanks, vaccines!
1/1	Got it. If I wind up with Covid hopefully it’ll be milder.

1/1	Got vaccinated, and life is back to normal. So worth it!

1/1	Got vaxxed as advised, no side effects apart from a slightly sore arm. Im well and healthy, so far not had COVID. Ditto everyone else in my family.
1/1	Got vaxxed n boosted. Not one, best shape of my life in fact. Most of the comments I see from unvaxxed are from older men that are roughly 60-90lbs overweight so I am not sure how you can quantify that data from such a tainted subject. lot of yall need to count your fuckin macros
1/1	Got vaxxed so I can see my grandma without worrying. 100% worth it.
1/1	Got vaxxed, got COVID later, but it was mild. That’s the point.
1/1	Got vaxxed, got boosted, and still haven’t caught COVID. W for me.
0/0	Government overreach at its finest.

1/1	Greetings from Mexico, my parents just got the Pfizer vaccine. They feel great! thanks to the scientist for this great achievement.
1/1	Growing evidence continues to show #COVID19 vaccination before & during pregnancy is safe & effective. If you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, get vaccinated to protect yourself and your baby.
1/1	Growing inactivated virus takes a lot longer to manufacture. MRNA/Vector Vaccines are revolutionary.
0/0	Guess how many people regret NOT getting it? Absolutely no one.
0/0	Guess us conspiracy theorists win again.
1/1	Guess you can't win , a vaccine saves lives, if you'd rather die or have a " possible" side effect the choice is yours,! No payments, simple choice, if I get a side effect so be it, I don't want to die, 4million people died in the UK of tuberculosis in the late 19 th century, no vaccines, many whole families wiped out in an instant, guess we are lucky to be here moaning and blaming science for trying to save us! they didn't get the choice, actually lucky your ancestors made it or you wouldn't be here to moan .!🤔
0/0	Guy i knew from work got the jab. And a week later died of blood clot in his lungs. Really healthy guy. Didn't drink or smoke

1/1	Ha if you only knew how effective vaccines really are. The mom kissing her son made me want to cry. she can kiss her son again
1/1	Had Astrazeneca 20 days ago. Was ill for 2 days (like a cold). I was told that most ppl get a fever in around 12 hrs and they hit the mark almost in a minute :D Cant wait for the second one to be done with it.
1/1	Had COVID before, never want it again! Thankful for vaccines.
0/0	Had COVID in 2020, and it was mild. Took the vaccine in 2021, and ever since, my immune system hasn’t been the same.
0/0	Had COVID-19, my immune system took care of it. I trust my immune response and do not trust yours! Get that out of here! You know this "vaccine" does not work as billed or sold! You should be ashamed , but your not! Take the shot? "I don't think so!"
0/0/0	Had Covid twice. Once before vaccine, once after. Neither time was THAT bad, but oddly the second was worse.
0/0	Had Covid, and I’m vaccinated, and I felt far worse after the vaccine than I did at any point while I had the actual disease.
0/0	Had a long-term Covid: so no vaccines for me thanks.

0/0	Had both shots and I have never felt quite right since
0/0	Had covid and it definitely wasn't more dangerous than that smh
1/1	Had first dose all good. Second vaccine soon.
1/1	Had it Tuesday. I felt fine until the next morning, woke up with crazy sore muscles and my vaccination arm was nearly useless. Today I feel fine, site is a bit sore. Since I treat COVID patients three days a week, totally worth it.
1/1	Had it before vaccine was available. Fever, extreme fatigue and pneumonia for a couple weeks. Wife works in healthcare so was vaccinated and never got sick. Got a variant post vaccination and booster 1, very mild fever for about 12 hours, no symptoms after 1 day. Negative test after 3 days. We went camping, no issues. Your mileage may vary.
0/0	Had massive heart palpitations after my first vaccine. I went to the gym later that day and soon after my workout they started. At times it genuinely felt like a heart attack. I was 18 or 19 then. Scary stuff regret ever getting vaccinated
1/1	Had my 2 Pfizer Vaccine jabs and no bad side effects a bit of fatigue for 2 days after but otherwise fine
1/1	Had my 2ed dose of Maderna. About 12 hours later had chills, mussel and joint aches, head ache and fever. My hair hurt. Could not sleep and gave up and got up at 04:30. This is about 20 hours in and I took some Aleve. That helped. Completely recovered over the next 12 hours.
1/1/1	Had my 2nd Pfizer jab yesterday, zero side effects.

1/1	Had the sniffles for a day after my booster. That’s it. Worth it.
1/1	Had to postpone our wedding reception from September of last year until September of this year due to COVID. Im losing it knowing we might have to compromise again because a handful of chuckleheads have politicized vaccination and new restrictions are potentially looming on the horizon. It’s a small gripe in the grand scheme of things, but it’s frustrating knowing the repercussions were/are entirely preventable this time around.
1/0	Had two doses of Moderna originally, pretty rough side effects on the second dose with headache and fatigue especially . Am definitely considering getting either of the other two for booster.
1/-1	Haha can’t wait to take it..

0/-1	Hahaha this is embarrassing
0/-1	Hahahaha the bad comedy continues
1/0	Half of my family didn't want to get vaccinated, including my mother. Too bad that the thing that got them all convinced had to be death of my grandfather (my mom's father) from covid.

0/1	Have 4 vaccines. Got COVID once in 2021. Had a headache and a cough for 2 days. Oh and couldn't taste onion for 2 weeks.
1/1	Have American anti vaxxers seen what's in the food they eat? Have they seen the nitrites in the meat and how quickly cells are damaged by them? Yet, they eat all of the garbage and poison sold by the corporations but are very afraid of a vaccine that will save their lives. Go figure.
0/0	Have We Sorted HIV or Cancer This Quick ??? All of a Sudden the magic potion drops from the Heavens and WE are supposed to Jump on Board Sleeves Rolled Up and Smiles on our Faces ... Anyone Remember the MMR jab 13 Years Ago ???
1/1	Have gotten only 1 dose yet, waiting until Wednesday to finally get my second shot (yes I have to wait until then to get my second shot, no I don't like it because it took so long to wait, my first shot was July 7th if you're wondering) and since it's the Pfizer one, I hope to get sick from it as it's a sign the vaccine is working correctly, only had a slightly sore arm after the first shot but nothing else otherwise
1/0	Have had covid and 2 other flus this year, had not been sick for 10 years prior to this. Vaccine? probabally
0/0/0	Have not taken it, probably never will. For me it started as a political statement but now it's also because I simply can't trust it.
1/1/1	Have taken the vaccine
1/1	Have the courage to risk a vaccination - No one who’s had one hasn’t been at least a little unsure. We have a chance to get COVID after a vaccination - the only other choice is to get COVID without one.
1/-1	Have to love conspiracy theorists nit wits. “I AiNt geTtin No miCroChips in Meh! “

1/1	Having read some of the comments below I am beginning to think the FT is home to secret anti-vaxers. To state the obvious, Covid is not like smoking etc in that a choice to partake is only a threat to yourself, it, on the other hand, is also life threatening to those in contact with you. Maybe it is my age and the fact that, rather than to do my own "research" in that font of truth called the Internet and social media, I trust the medical experts. In Ireland vaccination is at 90% plus, I amazed at the madness in parts of the USA.
1/-1	He does not think the vaccine is very effective, so he thinks she would eventually get COVID anyway and that the vaccine would just expose her even more to the damage the spike protein causes.
0/0	He hasn’t spoken about fully vaccinated people coming down with Covid....
0/0/0/0/0/0	He said vaccine will help reach herd immunity. So far the articles I have read says that you can still get Covid infection and spread it after you are vaccinated.
0/0/0/0	He said you have a greater chance of being struck by lightning than having an allergic reaction. I already have bad allergic reactions to many things...and I’ve actually been zapped by lightning! I’d be doomed!
1/1	He should have gotten the vaccine....
0/-1	He should hold hospitals and Healthcare facilities responsible for force vaccination or people lost their job. I was vaccinated against my will because I couldn't lose my job and everything I worked for. Now I have an endocrine disorder that I blame on the vaccine and there are medical studies now to back it up. I deserve compensation.

0/0	Help, I have fallen victim of one of the many side effects of vaccines
0/0	Her story is a similar story to all the Moms that have kids damaged by the children's vaccination schedule. Doctors deny bc they haven't been educated fully about the adverse reactions. Corrupt science at the FDA showed no association with the MMR and Autism, but a whistle blower involved said they changed the data. brbrWhat needs to happen is repealing the 1986 Act that gave vaccine companies immunity.

1/1	Here are the answers to some common questions. Please note that this video is about the scientific basis of mRNA vaccines in general, not about any particular vaccine or manufacturer. This video is not sponsored by anyone and does not represent endorsement of any particular vaccine. The answers below are based on well-known, basic knowledge of mRNA/cell biology and immunology, which can be found in ANY TEXTBOOK. More Q&amp;A may be added later.<br>Also note: this video was originally intended for our regular audience (med students), so it&#39;s more technical. We have a simpler version here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTLYXmgG8DU">https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU</a><br>For comparison of different vaccines, as well as events of immune response, role of different immune cells (T-cells, B-cells, APC), see this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osRo-yz1VQ8">https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8</a><br>Q1: How long the mRNA from vaccine will stay in human body? A: mRNA is very unstable, it is easily degraded by enzymes in our cells (RNAses). Average half-life of mRNA in human is around 10 hours. mRNA from vaccine is expected to stay no longer than a day.<br>Q2: How long the antigen (translated from mRNA vaccine) is expected to stay in our body? A: Several days. Once the immune system is activated, it will see the cells that carry the antigen as damaged and destroy them.<br>Q3: So from A to Q2, our immune system destroys our own cells, is that bad? A: No. This is the natural way the body detects foreign antigens, just like when an infection occurs – infected cells display pieces of the virus to alert the immune system and get killed. The difference is that you can control the dose with the vaccine, unlike a natural infection. And the vaccine does not multiply. The number of our own cells that will be killed with the vaccine dose is negligible. The effect is also limited to the cells around the injection site. Note that traditional vaccines also work this way: the antigen delivered by a traditional vaccine is also taken up by some of our cells, it is then broken into pieces and displayed on the surface of the cell to be &quot;seen&quot; by the immune system. This is the only way for the immune system to detect foreign antigens. The body will replace the lost cells within several days. For more details see this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osRo-yz1VQ8">https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8</a><br>Q4: So now the immune system will produce the antibodies, will it ever stop? A: It&#39;s the same process that happens when there is a natural infection. So, upon infection or vaccination, antibodies will take a couple of weeks to be produced, the level will peak for about a couple more weeks and then it will go down, no more production. But now the body remembers the virus because some memory cells are left - when you encounter the real virus these cells will produce antibodies again, this time instantly in response – so fast that no infection will occur. If the body does not encounter the virus then, no antibodies will be produced.<br>Q5: How about side effects? A: All vaccines have side effects, mRNA or traditional. The list of side effects should be available online or at any location that offers the vaccine.<br>Q6: How mRNA gets into cells? A: It is delivered in lipid covering that will fuse with cell membrane (also consists of lipids) - it&#39;s called endocytosis.<br>Q7: Is this gene therapy? A: No, gene therapy involves replacing your gene with a new one, this vaccine does not touch your genes.<br>Q8: Can mRNA vaccine change my DNA? See full A in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTLYXmgG8DU">https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU</a><br>Q9: I had COVID and recovered, do I still need the vaccine? A: You probably do not need the vaccine if your infection was recent, at least for now. The question remains is how long natural immunity will last, and how long protection by vaccine will last, we do not yet know the answers. UPDATE: 1 dose of mRNA vaccine in people with previous infection works as well as 2 doses in people without previous infection. Basically: previous infection gives the same immunity as 1 dose of mRNA vaccine.
1/1	Here are the stories of how hospitals and health systems are vaccinating a nation through creativity, collaboration and compassion.
1/1	Here immunity can reduce mutations. That’s why we need to vaccinate: to prevent mutation
0/-1	Here in Calif., I know 9 acquaintances that now have A.I.D..s .All have been vaxed. Perhaps it is just coincidental?
1/-1	Here in China, our vaccine record was part of out phone health record. Using bus, supermarket etc required clearance via a Phone QR code. Sadly it all ended in December 2022 and then 1.1b got infected in a couple of weeks.
1/1	Here in Indonesia there is no mandate for vaccines, but we are competing to get vaccines. For my mother, her first vaccine had to wait 3 hours because of the many people queuing up. For the second vaccine, at 6 am I was already queuing in front of the public health center to get a queue number, because the day before I came at 8 am, the quota for that day had run out. For me personally, my first vaccine queued for 2 hours. And for the second vaccine, I queued for 4 hours (because there were 3,000 people queuing for the vaccine that day). My whole family is fully vaccinated. And we are still strict with health protocols. Double mask when you have to leave the house, wash hands and take a shower when return home. Do not visit crowded places.
1/1	Here in Ireland, in both countries, those in the 0-19 years old unvaccinated age group now comprise the clear majority of cases. Having had one niece, 9, in intensive care with covid for a week, and with some teacher siblings endlessly recounting the dizzying amount of sick kids missing from their schools with covid, it's crystal clear here - and elsewhere across Europe - that, as irish and European medical experts have warned, unvaccinated children are at equal risk now in this pandemic. I'm very glad that my nephews and nieces are getting vaccinated here.
1/1/1/1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.

1/1	Here’s my opinion on Covid Vaccines. 1. They help reduce the severity of Covid. 2. The risks of the vaccine are likely less than the risks of Covid, but there are risks. 3. They don’t prevent the spread. 4. They shouldn’t be mandated. 5. It’s not immoral to refuse them.
0/0	Here’s the thing.. they don’t
0/0	Hes right most people distrust him and any vaccine,
1/1	Hey OP, I am a physician and I too, waited until I had enough data to take the vaccine myself. So I understand your position. I did, however, decide to get vaccinated once I knew the expected side effects. Although I work in clinical research, I'm new to the field and still learning the regulatory protocols so forgive me for not addressing those issues here. I'll let a more knowledgeable person handle that. Instead I'd like to try to explain why they chose the mRNA route rather than the so-called conventional route. mRNA is just like a sentence or instruction manual for making a protein. In this case, the mRNA is coding for the SPIKE protein, which is a protein on the surface of the virus that the virus requires to establish an infection. This mRNA is designed to teach the cells how to create the antibody to the spike protein.

0/0	Hi I just want to vent long story short my father got the covid vaccine and it all went downhill from there to the point where he developed ALS. Keep in mind he was a healthy man , didn't smoke, drink, eat unhealthy. Could be coincidence but idk just seems too correlated. I also work in a neurology facility and have had many pt come to me saying that they've been experiencing muscle weakness after getting the vaccine. Some of these patients are as young as in their early 20s! Sucks that some employers are still mandating this even after all the information that has come out
1/1	Hi I registered in February and up to now news.. I registered again for AZ still no updates. People who registered after me got their vaccines. call up helpdesk number busy all the time. Looks like i will get Covid first before I get my vaccine 1 1
0/0/0	Hi everybody...I wish to inject a cautionary note into this discussion. My first child received all her vaccines on schedule...and had adverse reactions with each one, some not so mild, mostly in the form of skin reactions a few of which appear to be with her in adult life. Therefore, my son did not get his vaccinations until later in life and suffered few if any ill effects. Now mind you, we spent years working with doctors on my daughters symptoms..I kept journals. What's the takeaway ? First of all, there are literally thousands of similar cases reported by other parents experiences with vaccines with the combined vaccines like the mmr being the most commonly involved. To wholesale dismiss their experiences as untrue and unimportant is utterly unscientific. Do you really want to throw out data that doesn't fit or is too much of an outlier for your science ?! Particularly when you are basically administering millions of doses in a vast experiment on a highly diverse population with absolutely no way to know the total outcome. And while vaccines appear not only to be massively profitable along with being statistically safe at a small percentage of bad outcomes let me personally assure you that if your healthy child is one of those percentages you will be both outraged and absolutely distrustful of vaccine claims of safety. Secondly, claims of the effectiveness of herd vaccination are not fully verified. Long before mass polio vaccination was anywhere close to a reality, polio was already in decline from improved sanitation practices and understanding worldwide. And smallpox herd immunity has never been achieved worldwide...it was eliminated by a combination of quarantining individual cases and inoculating and isolating all people they had been in contact with. Is the prudent and careful administration and monitoring of vaccines and important tool....absolutely ! But to give it blanket immunity against scrutiny because some groups have succumbed to spurious claims is just as bad as the reverse.
0/-1	Hi guys new viewer and fan for past few weeks. Random question here. What can help with muscle twitching and spasms throughout body and more intense pins and needles especially when sleeping. Any suggestions? These occured soon after 2 jabs 4 years ago and still having issues. Had MRI 4 years ago at age 36 and thankfully came back negative, my father died from complications of MS and neurologist wanted to rule that out but completely dismissed it could be from these recent jabs. Still worried about long term affects.

0/0/0/0/0	I NEVER took any of the shots and NEVER got COVID - thank God and my caution.
0/0	I PERSONALLY know of THREE people in my life who had myocarditis, one of them being a 15 year old boy that collapsed on the hockey rink and died. I think these stats are hugely under-reported.
1/1	I REALLY appreciate that Dr. Yasmin made the distinction between Anti-Vaxers and Vaccine-Hesitant. Ostracizing and mocking people hesitant to take a vaccine that was developed in an insanely short period of time is counterproductive. I think it is reasonable for people to want more evidence than they might usually require for such a vaccine.
1/-1/1	I WANT TO BECOME A volunteers OF CORONA VIRUS.....i don’t need any payment....i just want to help of corona patients..... Plz help me
0/0/0	I WILL NOT TAKE THIS SHOT, bite me.
0/-1	I WON'T TRUST ALL THAT TESTING ALL SWABS USED FOR TESTING COVID ALL COME FROM CHINA.
1/1	I Want to Live, I will get my Vaccine.
1/1/1	I Will Get The Vaccine
1/1	I absolutely LOVE how scientific advancement is cumulative. This demonstrates that fact very clearly. Nicely done.
0/0	I absolutely don't trust any company's COVID vaccine.
1	I absolutely will get this vaccine. I never get the flu shot because I rarely get the flu and a flu virus is not completely foreign to my body. Covid 19, however, doesn't trigger an immune response in our bodies so do your body a favor & send the cells a map for how to fight it.
0/0	I absolutely won't get a second vaccine shot; my body felt too awful after the last one.
1/1	I accept all vaccines if this is legally in this world
0/-1	I actually had myocarditis when I had the vaccine and was in the age range where it was more common. Kinda funky feeling, first time in an ICU.
1/1	I admire Dr. Offit and agree with him, in principle, that the availability of vaccines in record time was lifesaving.
1/1	I agree with vaccines!
1	I agree. I've also received my 1st and 2nd doses of the Pfizer vaccine in December 2020/January 2021. No side effects whatsoever.
0/0	I ain't DOIN it
0/0	I ain’t gonna be forced into being a test subject!
1/1	I almost died in Golden Gate Park with COVID Delta while homeless. The most extreme hallucinations. The worst aches and pains. I couldn't make it to the hospital. Nobody would help me. I had no phone to call for help. I am so lucky that wasn't the end. I was vaxed and boosted. If I hadn't been I would be dead.
1/1	I already got the vaccine!
0/1	I already had covid and it wasn't that bad. Be a healthy person and eat good foods and a low sugar diet. Do things that help boost your immunity system like exercise and supplements. A normal immunity system will kick covid butt. There should never be a one size fits all mentality when it comes to health care. All covid vaccines are experimental and have no long term safety testing. Have a great day.
1/1	I already have heart problems and other things, still be having the vaccine the virus is more likely to do me in than a vaccine is.
1/1	I already have mine. The government where I live in Hong Kong have an app where you can store your vaccination record electronically and once you do that, you can add a vaccine pass to your Apple Wallet which comes with a QR code
0/0	I already knew the flu shot was a scam, every year I did I got respiratory illnesses, I stopped that well over a decade ago and I quit getting sick like that. Super rare and quicker healing time.
1/0/0	I also had a really bad reaction to the COVID vaccine. My lupus flared so bad because my immune system was so overwhelmed. I worry if my daughter has any autoimmune issues, what could happen.
1/1	I also have Crohn's disease going on 10+ years now. Had Pfizer and I'm 100%
0/0	I also regret getting the jab, and the more I read and hear about it, the more I regret it.
0/0	I also regret getting the jab, and the more I read and hear about it, the more I regret it. I'm healthy, exercise daily, try and eat well. That's the best I can do.
0/0	I also regret it, more importantly I regret getting my 8 year old the vaccine.
1/1	I also want to get vaccinated, but I don't have the money. Can anyone sponsor me?
1/1	I always feel like anti vaxx people are just scared of the needles
1/1	I always get a flu and covid vaccine. When given the opportunity to protect myself and others I will take it.
1/-1	I always look forward to hearing from Offit.
1/0	I always say Conspiracy Theorists get excited and for attention like to create their own unproven theories to reach out to impressionable pple and convince them to follow it.
1/0	I always thought that the Covid vaccine was a intelligence test .
1/1	I always wanted to get the AstraZeneca jab, the vaccine is constantly tested with different variants, and it is the most used vaccine in the world. i was supposed to get the chinese vaccine because AstraZeneca is preserved for elders. luckily they were running low in supply, so the doctor gave me AstraZeneca instead, jackpot!!
1/-1/1	I always wanted to see you getting a short and I support your videos
0	I always wondered & asked god why my son was born on Xmas eve 24th Dec 2019. Now I know. So blessed that he is Covid vaccine free! Thank you god!
0/0	I always worry these companies only report the good and hide the bad. They're never going to take responsibility for side effects.
0/0	I am "older folk". I never got the shot but did get COVID. One week down. Have, when I was younger, worse flu.
1/1/1	I am 14 and fully vaccinated 😁🥰
1/1	I am 14 but I have faith and belief in our system and science. Covid vaccines are a ray of hope in such distressing times of the pandemic.
1/1	I am 4 times vaccinated against COVID. As a historian, I rate vaccination as one of the greatest accomplishments of mankind.
1/-1	I am 50+ so got one last fall and will do so again this fall.
1/1	I am Fully Vaccinated but still get covid-19 / Im65 years old . I cannot breath it feels like my lungs is going to come out to my Mouth. i have all the symptoms.. except No Fever at all. I Tell you all Ppol if you are fully vaccinated you will survive. its been a month now and a 100% better. 10/30/2021
1/1	I am a doctor in the U.K. I had the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. The benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks! All vaccines will have some degree of risk. The most important thing about vaccination is that it will significantly reduce the chances of you dying or ending up on a ventilator regardless of which vaccine you have!
1/1	I am a fully vaxxed, 68M, in relatively good health. I recently became sick and tested positive for Covid. I recovered in about a week. Others, including people I know, especially early on, died after contracting Covid. All that I knew that died were unvaxxed. Did being vaxxed help me avoid hospitalization, or is the virus just weaker now? Testing positive a few years ago would have terrified me, now not so much.
0/0	I am a healthy young person. I haven’t gotten sick since the pandemic. Why do I and fellow like Americans have to be forced to vaccinate ??? Vaccination has not been proven to reduce rates of transmission or asymptomatic career
1/1	I am a long-term care nurse, will take the vaccine and be responsible.....no issues taking both doses when offered..I trust science, have faith and I am using my common sense...
1/0	I am a proud antivax parent of 5 kids edit: 4 kids
1/1	I am a teacher. We all want our kids back in school. This is the smart choice to get us all back to the place we want to be. For the kids, your future (and teachers, so these kids can STAY in school) PLEASE GET VACCINATED
0/0	I am afraid of Covid Vaccine, madam. Is there any side effect..no injection yet on my arm.
0/0	I am against vaccination, because 41% of Italians are worried about the side effects of vaccines, especially young people.
0/0	I am allergic to the vaccine. It almost killed me
1/1	I am almost 16 and got my Pfizer and all that happened was a sore shoulder 3 days and for 1 day a minor headache
0/0	I am also pro-informed consent but looking at the back stabbing by our own government as well as big pharma now I am going to call myself a NEVER VAXER. all trust is gone.
1/1	I am also pro-vax and my daughter is fully vaxxed per CDC schedule.
1/1	I am always amazed at why people allow themselves to believe this rubbish. Is it stupidity or just blind faith that leads them to believe such outrageous, baseless bullshit? By conflating vaccines with this pseudo-religious babble, they put themselves and others at risk. Shameful
0/0	I am an 68 year old woman. The last time I was hospitized was in 1960, right after the Polio vaccine , I developed Viral Encephalitis post Chicken Pox! I NEVER take the flu vaccine, rarely got the flu. If I did get the flu ,I treated it with Homeopathic remedies. I was a US Navy Nurse Corps scholarship student in college. I left nursing, got an Honorable Discharge and became a Special Education teacher for 37 years! When I retired from teaching I had 300 Unused Sick Days. I take ZERO prescription drugs. I use ONLY vitamins & some herbs. I am recovering from Covid-19. The very first time I ever got it! I have relatives who were vaxed and had Covid 19 three times!!!!! I didn't get vaxed! When I got Covid 19 , I was NEVER hospitized. I was given a drug to reduce nausea! I am recovering at home!
0/0	I am an antivaxer since it's inception.
0/0	I am an athlete. I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago. The next day after the vaccine, I couldn't sleep. I had the worst fever ever.
0/0/0/0/0/0/1/0/0	I am an athlete. I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago. The next day after the vaccine, I couldn't sleep. I had the worst fever ever. Today is my 3rd day after the second shot, I feel normal but my stamina when I workout is not the same. I feel like I get fatigued much faster than before and I run out of breath much faster than I used to. I swear I am not lying.
1/0	I am an uniformed idiot so my opinion isn't worth much, but the booster shot timing seems terrible. The boosters get released after the summer surge is already over but far enough in advance of new winter surge variants that the vaccines seem to be minimally effective.
1/1	I am anti-parachute, because if I jump out of a plane with a parachute, I could still die
0/0	I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially
0/0	I am concerned about long term side effects. I've heard this vaccine could affect fertility and that scares me
0/0	I am currently in school for nursing and was told today I do not have to get the vaccine!!! 👏🎉🥳 thank god 🙏
1/1	I am doing it because the risk of COVID is higher than vaccine
1/1	I am doing it because the risk of COVID is higher than vaccine . It’s a simple risk management
1/1	I am excited to think of where this technology can go. Tailored vaccine within days? Cancer vaccine? HIV? In utero cures for genetic disease? The sky is the limit.
0/0	I am feeling effects of Moderna second shot. Was fine for first week after 2nd dose, then my stomach has not been the same sense. I would not get second Moderna shot if I could do it over again, it sucks
1/1	I am from Bangladesh, which is a third world country. Before WHO and the government stepped in, hundreds of kids used to die from preventable diseases like measles, small pox etc. My own cousin died from small pox at age of 2 because she didn't receive the vaccine on time. Hearing people in the 1st world country saying vaccines are harmful makes me really sad and angry at the same time.
1/1/1	I am from India. Our Covid-19 vaccine is working and I have seen that there are very few side effects.
0/0	I am from the Czech Republic, vaccinated people were registered as still unvaccinated for the first 14 days after vaccination. I know of several cases of elderly people who died within 2 to 5 days after vaccination. They were in the unvaccinated category.
1/1	I am fully vaccinated and boosted. I have had close prolonged contact with people infected with Covid at least 8 times that I’m aware of. I have never gotten Covid. People I know who have been vaccinated and gotten Covid have only had mild sympto
1/1	I am fully vaccinated and have had no issues, it’s safe, and well tested. But yes, you still can catch COVID with the vaccine but it pretty much eliminates the symptoms which is the way that the virus is spread to others.
1/1	I am fully vaccinated and have my booster planned for early December, so I consider myself very pro vaccine.
1/1/1/1/1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1/1	I am fully vaxxed and boosted. Have had covid 4 times and was almost hospitalised on two occasions. Healthy, young person. I think I would have died without the vaccine.
1/1	I am getting my 2nd booster this week and I just had my flu shot and I feel no side effects at all.
0/0	I am glad I never listened to any of these medical "professionals" and got the vaccine nor did I allow any of my kids to get it.
0/0	I am glad I never listened to any of these medical "professionals" and got the vaccine nor did I allow any of my kids to get it. Logic, skeptism and lack of research was my guiding light

0/0	I am glad I refused to take the covid vaccine. I faced a lot of ridicule and shaming from friends and relatives for my vaccine hesitancy. But now I am vindicated.
0/0/0/0/0/0	I am glad I watched this because it helped me realise that the shots are certainly unsafe.
1/1	I am glad that my family and I got our vaccines! We did not experience any side affects either!
1/1	I am going to be vaccinated right now, God bless you guys !
1/1	I am going to get the vaccine! It sounds totally safe and well-tested. It’s going to teach my body to fight COVID.
1/1	I am going to get the vaccine! It sounds totally safe and well-tested. It’s going to teach my body to fight COVID. That is a good thing. I can’t wait to get it.
0/-1	I am going to let others take the vaccine first and then wait, see what happens to them. Only then i will take the vaccine because I don't trust the government and nor the people they surround themselves with.
1/1/1/1	I am going to take AstraZeneca since in Australia getting that is optional and i can take it right away but if i wanted biontech i will have to wait and i really don't want to wait i just want to get this over with honestly.
1/1	I am grateful for the vaccine. I pushed hard to get vaccinated as early as I could qualify and I succeeded in completing the double vaccination three months before I got Covid. I was pretty darned sick, but I did not die.
1/1	I am grateful to my parents for getting me vaccinated. I am genuinely baffled and frustrated by anti-vaxers.
1/1	I am happily vaccinated, the day of side effects was worth it, I feel more powerful.
1/1	I am happy I finally am among the millions who are fully vaxxed.
1/1	I am happy the number of vaccinated keeps rising! Some catch on more slowly than others but we will get there!!
0/-1	I am happy you are all still around!! THANK YOU, GOD!
1/1	I am having a difficult time understanding the anti vaccination responses here. This vaccine could save your life and more importantly the life of a loved one or friend.!
1/1	I am immunocompromised. Diabetic and ileostomy. First place I went to was my doctor instead of my phone. I had some concerns about the vaccine. We discussed it. Couldn't get the needles fast enough. Covid for me is a death sentence. I took my chances and am fine. I also know that some people can't for actual medical reasons (not the radicalized political ones). So I got vaccinated for myself, and them.
1/1	I am in a nursing home. I got my short because of my many health problems. I pray to GOD in Jesus name it works!!
1/0	I am in favor of vaccination. I am simply not in favor of mandating it, and do not believe flu/covid vaccination is necessary. Polio on the other hand is a bit different. While it's true that sanitation did more than vaccination did to defeat it, it's still a good idea.
1/-1	I am in favour of vaccines (they clearly work) but against them being mandatory. If I didn’t want one, being forced would be terrible.
0/0	I am in my 40s and unvaccinated for Covid-19. Every day that goes by I am more grateful.
1/1	I am in perfect health and have never had COVID to my knowledge. The only significant reaction I had was the first AZ - that was a shocker. The first Moderna produced a mild reaction that lasted a week. I’m so grateful to be protected, take vit D and get sunlight every day. If you have a positive mindset about vaccines, you will bounce back and do exceptionally well
1/1	I am in the rural western United States and my family has been ripped apart by COVID-19 misinformation. My in-laws have chosen not to be present in our lives because we have a son with asthma and I am immunosuppressed due to organ transplant and we asked them to be vaccinated to minimize our risk. They don’t want to get turned into homosexuals (I wish I were kidding) or get tracked or made radioactive…Has this happened in other societies or is it just my dysfunctional family that does this?
1/1	I am more concerned that foolishness like this would make people avoid the vaccine when/if it comes. This man needs to be locked up!
0/0	I am more scared of the vaccine than the virus
1/-1	I am neutral on the matter. I got it cause you pretty much had to.
1/0	I am not a scientist. But believe a vaccine is giving you the virus in small dose so you build up immunity. COVID 19 has had no long term testing. A fact? Thalidomide had the same. No long term testing. What I believe is we will have to pay more tax or insurance for travel , going to a restaurant, and we will need a vaccine passport equivalent to a status card which shows all your details. Some people say a nazi state, I think equivalent of having a Star of David on arm, and I am not Jewish.
1/1	I am not afraid of the vaccine but I hope the next day's sick leave is given after the injection.
0/0/0	I am not an anti-vaxxer but i am against vaccines which contain mercury or the vaccines which arent checked and have side effects
0/0	I am not anti vaccine. I am anti Covid vaccine. I might get them in the next 20 years when I know they are safe to get.
0/1	I am not anti-vax but anti-eugenic policy yes.
1/1	I am not as I just said, denying that vaccines are necessary to prevent the human race from disappearing. More individuals die without it though. I have every right to
0/0	I am not confident in the vaccine. We hear of the short term effects, what are the long term? Several people have had adverse reactions and one passed out. Need more time.
0/0	I am not getting it im not damaging my health and i dont want to be monitered just leave me alone
0/0	I am not getting vaxed.
0/0	I am not going for the second one because the first one almost killed me. Healthy 28 year old man
0/0	I am not gonna take any vaccine. Klaar
0/0	I am not risking my health to take the vaccine when I know my body can take care of the virus on its own.
0/0	I am not vaccinated. I got covid19 once and I let my immune system to deal with it. I am fully recovered afterwards. Maybe I am lucky but I think getting the shot is more risky than getting the infection.
0/0	I am now staunchly anti vaccine!
0/0	I am parent of a child who is a victim of vaccine damage. This gave me enough learning to cut the unnecessary vaccines on my second child.
1/1	I am perfectly fine with boosting with J & J.
1/1	I am pro vaccine and I got both the shots very early(back in February).
1/1	I am pro vaccine and my mom is anti-vaxx. We have had conversations about vaccinating any potential kids. I am someone who has had negative reactions to vaccines i.e. rashes and I still believe they are worth it.
1	I am pro-vaccine because I believe in protecting those who are unable to get vaccinated.
1/1	I am pro-vax. But I would say that vaccines are not 99% safe, but like a lot higher than the anti vaxxers lead people to believe.
1/1	I am proudly fully vaccinated! I’m doing my part by telling my friends and family to get protected as well :)
1/1	I am righ-wing in my country (Spain) and I am by no means an antivaxxer. In fact, I had 4 doses and I watch all your videos.

0/0	I am scared for the vaxed.
1/1	I am severely immunocompromised and can't get vaccinated, but I'm very excited for it to be out and for the possibility of the pandemic to get better! I haven't been outside or seen people other than my fiancé since February 2020
0/0	I am sick of the lie that side effects are very low. Many people have sustained serious permanent damage because of trusting a broken and corrupt system. How can a doctor give a medication to someone knowing that hat it may cause harm? Those injections are dangerous and should not be given to anyone.
0/0	I am skeptical about the safety of the vaccine, and I feel that it has been developed too fast.
0/0	I am so glad i went with my gut and did not comply !! God bless all that did .
1/1	I am so glad! Thank you for the work you do. I was hospitalized through the ED 2x during covid (transplant complications) It was the nurse from the line team that suggested to the ED doc that she order an ultrasound and look for a clot. Sure enough my 104° fever was from an infection around an 18 inch clot from my PICC line. That nurse saved my life. I hope she too has had an opportunity to become vaccinated. You all are incredibly special people!
1/1	I am so grateful I got the vaccine 2 months ago
1/1	I am so happy I got that
1/1	I am so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle.
0/0/0/0	I am so relieved I did not take it and neither did my husband or kids. I can sleep at night knowing that poison is not in us. It disgusts me that people who hang onto ignorance because they are scared it's in them can't look around at all the people speaking out. All the young people who collapsed and died is heart breaking
1/1/0	I am so sorry for children with anti-vax parents
0/-1	I am so sorry, hope you are well
1/1	I am so thankful for vaccines. Any risk is far outweighed by the benefits.
0/0/0	I am so thankful that I stuck to resisting the lies that were the Covid campaign & never took the vax. Not only was there outside pressure but my 2 sisters were pressuring me citing my 96 yr old Mom. I didn’t speak to them for 4 months. It’s all good now
0/0/0	I am so thankful that myself and my whole family didn’t get vaccinated. None of my kids have ever been vaccinated! I wish my parents gave me the choice
0/0	I am soooo f*ckin' glad I said no

0/0	I am still not seeing where it is conclusively safe in the long-term.
1/1	I am suddenly pro Covid vaccine for all women.
0/-1	I am sure the true number of dislikes are probably 100k or more.
1/1	I am terrified of needles. Normally when I hear people talking about vaccines I get super light headed and sometimes actually pass out. I'm slowly exposing myself to images and videos of vaccines and needles so that, when it comes time, the process is easier for me. Getting the vaccine was never in question. I will not be responsible for someone's death if I can help it.
1/1	I am thankful and grateful that we are both vaxxed and look forward to getting my 2nd J&J vaxx in January (once my 30 days post-Covid have passed)
1	I am thinking that nobody know nothing but I will trust the vaccine and do the second dose
1/1	I am triple vaxed and soooo glad to have access to the vaccine.
0/0	I am truly puzzled why so many people say that you need to get vaccinated even if you had Covid (real symptoms plus testing positive). That does not make any sense. How can the body's response to the real virus be less adequate than a vaccine?
0/0/0/0/0	I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
1/-1	I am unvaccinated and got covid last january thank God I survived
1/1/1/1	I am vaccinated and I got COVID. But, I was not in the hospital with pneumonia and I certainly wasn't taking up room in an ICU. I'm convinced given my pre existing conditions that if I had not taken the vaccine, I would have been in the ICU and maybe even dead.
1/-1	I am vaccinated and because of these anti-vaccine people I got chickenpox and it was horrible, because I ended up having sequelae and inflammation in the nerve of the brain that if I put my hand on my head it still hurts. I get extremely irritated and stressed when I see these people..
1/1	I am vaccinated and have 2 vaccinated daughters, and will continue to vaccinate any future children I have because I would rather be safe than end up in the emergency room with a disease that has not been around for years... people forget how bad it used to be before vaccines that now they are taken for granted.
1/1	I am vaccinated and my partner is vaccinated. Our children will be vaccinated. I look at it this way, I would rather them have a little pain from a tiny pinch from a needle than a lot of pain from the scary diseases.
1/1/1	I am vaccinated and no side effects so far thank you making vaccine and now to get the booster shot
1/1	I am vaccinated and would encourage others to do so.
1/1	I am vaccinated and would encourage others to do so. However, I wonder how far the current administation is willing to go. Quarantine camps?
0/0	I am vaccinated by the blood of Jesus. I do not need vaccine
1/-1	I am vaccinated today and my arm sore 24 hour I am very excited to see the end of Corona 😭😂😂😂😭☺️
1/1	I am vaccinated with no side effects so you're likely lying or having other issues and if so you should see a counselor
1/1	I am vaccinated, and, so are my children.
1/1/1/1/1/1	I am vaccinated. Am I dead? No. antivaxxers wrecked
0/0	I am very glad I refused the vax. I got Covid once & it was not good, but I never got it again. Family members who did get vaccinated, have gotten Covid multiple times.
1/1	I am very happy to be living in Europe. In my country the vaccine was a available just last month for people under 60, and already more than 60% of the population is vaccinated.
1/1	I am very happy with two pfizer vaccines!!!
1/1	I am watching this because I received my 1st booster today Pfizer. I am experiencing the same effect as my first and 2nd dose of Astrazeneca so I am curious how vaccine works and why i am still experiencing the side effects.brbrThank you so much for this informative video!
1/1	I am willing to take the J&J vaccine
0/0	I am worried about the long-term effects of the vaccine on under 15 age children
0	I and my whole family, including my adult children stopped doing shots when Obama was in office. The swine flu, then, the whooping cough, all a bunch of worthless fear.

1/1	I appreciate the transparency from doctors and scientists about the vaccine.
0/0	I appreciate this channel but I remember when it forcefully encouraged vaccination without long-term safety data. Sadly, there was/is no long-term safety data available. Obviously, the spike protein is inherently damaging.
1/1/1	I appreciate vaccines I was bit by a rabid cat at 4yrs old and a vaccine saved my life!
0/0	I asked a nurse at my GP practice if the RSV jab was an mRNA vaccine or a traditional vaccine. She did not know and tried to find out for me. She couldn’t find anything that said what sort of vaccine it was. She seemed confused by my question. Even the nurses and doctors are unaware of the difference. How sad
0/0	I ate a shit load of flintstone vitamins I'm immortal
0/0	I avoided getting my family vaccinated whenever possible. Do we really need doctors to tell us the truth? If you actually read the Phase 3 clinical trials, you'd see these vaccines are basically useless, at least the COVID ones.
1/1	I beg everyone to get vaccinated; I truly hope the pandemic ends soon.

1/1	I believe in the importance of vaccines for public health.
0/0	I believe in the near future unvaxed blood will be worth more than solid gold. My tinfoil hat has made me rich
1/1	I believe in the power of vaccination. It’s how we can defeat the virus and protect our future.
1/1	I believe in the power of vaccines to save lives.
0/0	I believe my body is capable of fighting off the virus naturally
1/0	I believe some of the vaccines are unnecessary but the ones that are shouldn't be given to babies all at once. Moreover the COVID shot isn't a vaccine in my opinion.
1/1	I believe that getting vaccinated is the best way to ensure we can return to normal life.
0/0	I believe that the rise in number of SDS (sudden death syndrome) among healthy individuals should be a concern for anyone who has had the initial spike protein vaccination and at least 1 booster. You really need to look the information yourselves (and not from a “compromised” source). People who have taken the vaccinations, are participating in the largest drug trial in history…with ZERO recourse if you are injured because of it.
0/0	I believe the government is exaggerating the threat of COVID-19.
0/0	I believe the vaccine is a form of government control, and I’m against it.
1/1	I believe the vaccine is essential for public health and the only way to overcome the pandemic.
0/0	I believe the vaccine is just a way for governments to control us. I’m not taking it.
1/1	I believe the vaccine is safe and a critical step towards defeating the pandemic.
0/0	I believe there is a lack of transparency regarding the development and testing of the vaccines
0/0	I believe these statistics are completely fabricated. They’re not credible at all.
1/1	I believe they're safe and encourage many people to take them.
0/0	I believe this happened to my niece and other family that acted in ways that wasn’t typical of them after getting vax.
1/1	I believe you should get vaccinated. It protects against severe illness, hospitalization & death.
1/-1	I believe you.
1/1	I bet all of the dislikes are from antivaxxers as well
0/0	I bet in 10 years we will look back at the vaxx as a big mistake.
1/-1	I bet this will be in history
1/1	I bet your "research" came from a meme.
0/0	I blame the vaccine for so much. I'm nothing like I was before it
0/0/0/1/0	I blame the vaccine for so much. I'm nothing like I was before it.
0/0	I call it being Street Wise! Or even Common Sence!? My Mum had One at the start but I managed too convince her to not do it again. Thank god! Respects to all the Casualties of this discrase! How can a DRUG Company be non liable?
1/1	I came here looking for crazy-ass anti-vaxxer conspiracy comments...and I wasn't disappointed. Beautiful stuff.
0/1	I can hear it now, "I'm not getting that fucking vaccine" "Yes you are" "You're right, I am"
0/0	I can not for the life of me, imagine getting another one of these "jabs" - after the plethora of information and risks involved with them, has come out.
0/0	I can only imagine how it must feel knowing you have that flowing through your veins.
1/1	I can say this, my whole family took the vaccine and neither of us experienced any major side effects.
0/0	I can see people have gone nuts too since they got the vaccine
1/1	I can show this to my girlfriend but she will STILL not get vaccinated.What on earth does it take?
1/1	I can speak from my experience. I got two shots and got Covid twice back to back all in about 2 months. As soon as I felt okay I got my wife pregnant lmao
0/0	I can tell you I had a horrible reaction to the Moderna vaccine back on August 17, 2021. I have suffered for almost 6 months now from pain and suffering. It started right after the vaccine. I only had on shot. I think everyone should have the right to choose but after what happened to me I wish I never took it. I wouldn't be having to deal with pain and suffering now if I just listened to my senses.
1/1	I can't believe USA antivax propaganda has reached us. It is undeniable that there's an increase of people experiencing heart, lung and other issues. As of now we do not know how much of that can be attributed to the vaccines or coronavirus itself. What we do know is that without the vaccines, millions (if not billions) would be dead by now. People have forgotten what it was like in the midst of the pandemic where someone we knew was dying or hospitalised practically every day.
0/0	I can't believe how stupid people are.
0/-1	I can't believe people are actually crying, "Inject me now!"
1/1	I can't believe there are still so many people who don't trust vaccines! Public education really needs to be stepped up.
0/0	I can't believe this is still being pushed for everyone.
1/1	I can't stand anti vaxxers and misinformation spreaders. But thanks to this video I know how to deal with such meanies
1/1	I can't wait for covid-19 to end PLEASE just take the vaccine
1/1	I can't wait for taking the shot and covid-19 end
1/1	I can't wait to get my vaccine! But then again I understand the process of mRNA translation unlike anti-vaxxers. Y'all need to take a refresher course on DNA RNA and protein synthesis. Ya know...Because science and evidence
0/0	I can't wait to learn what else continues to come out over the years.
1/1	I cannot recommend enough that everyone get their booster annually.
0/0/0	I cannot trust a vaccine produced this quick. So many steps skipped and we don’t know if long-term side effects are a thing.
0/0	I cannot understand why a healthy person who has a near perfect medical history, not on any medication, near perfect BMI, strong immune system should even consider having this experimental thing.
0/0	I cannot wait to get my 10th booster this year so I can still catch and spread covid. I might even get lucky and get myocarditis and blood clots like thousands of others that injected this 100% safe and effective medical miracle
0/0	I cant believe anyone was stupid enough to get one in the first place
0/0	I cant sleep. It's been 28hrs since my 1st Moderna shot and I've slept maybe 4 hrs.
0/0	I can’t believe how people could do this to themselves, SHEEP!
0/0	I can’t imagine coming to grips if you are a vaxxed person knowing you’ve increased your chances for all the different medical major issues.
1/1	I can’t respect an anti vaxxer because they’d rather get polio and die than get arthritis? Like what??
1/1	I can’t wait to get it!
1/-1	I caught COVID after vaccination, but it was just like a mild cold.
1/1	I caught covid delta and got 2 vaccines while i was still sick and ive been immune to it ever since. Ive been immune to all strains and new strains.
1/1	I caught it last Christmas and had a short safe recovery. I'll continue to take it.
1/1	I checked this video because i was curious about "anti-vaxers" but these guy's know their stuff and what they say is absolutely correct about the covid- 19 vaccine so don't worry guys! GET THE VACCINE!
1/1	I choose to get vaccinated without regrets, and urge others to do the same.
0/0	I choose to protect myself from exposure instead of taking the vaccine.
1/1	I choose to vaccinate because I want to protect my community
0/-1	I choose what I want to put in my body and the vaccine is something I want take and neither will my kids
0	I chose to protect myself from exposure instead of taking the vaccine
1/1	I chose to volunteer and participate to help get the vaccine out! Very Happy for the Vaccine day today at Great Britain!
1/1	I cleared getting the Pfizer vaccine with my Doctor. My workplace required it.
0/0	I come from China, and I want to make it clear that Chinese vaccines are equally toxic. There may not be mRNA vaccine toxicity verification, but it has been proven that many people, including young people, have died
1/1	I commented this once and an anti vaxxer told me herd immunity isn’t a thing and that vaccines don’t in fact work...they’re so deluded
1/1	I completely understand the anxiety. Both of our twins just got their Covid vax and did very well! They got it alongside their others at the 6 month appointment and this was the least fussy they have been after any of these appointments.
0/0	I consider not getting a COVID vaccination one of the healthiest decisions I've made, right up there with quitting smoking cigarettes.
1/1/1/1	I continue to get COVID boosters because I am in a high-health risk group (I am 74 years old)
0/-1	I could have not taken the vaccine because i had never ever covid 19 even during quarantine i was the most fittest boy in my house, everyone had covid 19 slightly but i was safe.brbrBut somehow after quarintine i took my vaccine in 2022 and till now its been a another world i am seeing everything changed even my body condition are different now, and i know this is the only side effects of vaccine.
1/1	I couldn't find it available for my age range last year, but this year's covid vaccine is supposed to be updated for the latest variants so I'm going to try to find it. Soooo many people are still getting covid. It's worth the protection.
1/1	I could’ve written that. It was me to a T. Kids are vaccinated on schedule but I was hesitant on covid for the same reasons. So I hesitated and my kids got covid. My littlest ended up in the hospital at 1 am with a fever of 104.something that we couldn’t get down with Tylenol, fast shallow breathing, and lethargy. I could absolutely have been without that experience. It sucked and I felt SO bad because I was vaccinated myself.
0/-1	I decided not to take the vaccine for personal reason and because of it I got kicked out of the military, now tell me how that is fair
0/0	I decided to get the COVID vaccine because everyone kept saying how important it was, but honestly, I’ve been pretty disappointed with the whole experience. The process itself wasn’t terrible, but the side effects have been awful. I felt fine immediately after the shot, but the next day, I had a fever
1/1	I decided to get vaccinated in April because I knew I would be attending two crowded events in May and July. Although I knew the vaccine wouldn't fully protect against the dominant variant, the science showed it would significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization. I ended up getting COVID but was fortunate not to require hospitalization, which shows the vaccine worked as intended to protect me.
1/1	I definitely contribute that to the vaccine which is safe and good!
1/1	I definitely had to take the day off after round 2 of Moderna. Thats as 2 months ago. Me my staff all 4 of my grandparents have been fully vaccinated. No side effects and lab confirmed antibody immunity. Hooray science!
0/0	I definitely won’t let my child get this newly developed vaccine—it’s not safe.
1/1	I definitely would get the vaccine as soon it is available. But about a small thing I still wonder: Infected people have just a short immunity afterwards how and why does the Vaccine have a long lasting effect? Maybe the answer is in the video and just went over my head.
1/1/1/1/1	I definitely would get the vaccine as soon it is available. But about a small thing I still wonder: Infected people have just a short immunity afterwards, how and why does the Vaccine have a long lasting effect? Maybe the answer is in the video and just went over my head.
1/1	I definitely would get the vaccine as soon it is available. … how and why does the Vaccine have a long lasting effect?
0/0/0	I developed heart problems. I will need ever take a jab .
1/1/1	I did a postdoc in a maternal-fetal medicine lab studying COVID-19 epidemiology, including in pregnant people. This was in 2020/2021 so we were able to study before and after the vaccines became available. Getting the vaccine while pregnant is much safer than getting covid while pregnant.
1/1	I did and I’m here. No side effects.
1/-1	I did it Don’t recommend if you have to go to work the next day high chances if u get sick
0/-1	I did listen to doctors, but then they got censored or lost their jobs

0/-1	I did not get Covid vaccine yet and only get Covid once in this life time so I plan to stay away from them for now
0	I did not got vaccine so my Concern is for family and friends.
0/0	I did not want the shots but was forced as a nurse. Got the first two Pfizer and got horribly ill. Refused the boosters and have been harassed over it. It’s been two years and I’m living with side effects from it
0/0	I did not want the shots but was forced as a nurse. Got the first two Pfizer and got horribly ill. Refused the boosters and have been harassed over it. It’s been two years and I’m living with side effects from it. Extreme fatigue, vision issues, and heart palpitations. I applaud this girl standing up for what is right. The way people are treated who said no to the vaccines is disgusting, their concerns are real and should be listened to.
0/-1	I did the initial shot and booster. Like the flu shot, my body did not like it.
0/0	I did what they told me, but still got COVID multiple times!
1/1	I did. The vax is safe and effective.....
1	I didn't experience any side effects from both shots haha
0/0	I didn't get a jab. Why I caught swine flu 2009? I went and had tests to check my immunity. I still have the result from back in 2020. So high in immunity i would have to be recently jab for the third time!!!! My immunity is higher now as I got Covid 19 and another one. I didn't even know with covid 19 i was not sick. I could not taste then I knew. Why no one was tested for immunity???? I have two close friends injuried by vaccine. One had one jab within hours she was rush to hospital.. They said she could not take another jab. This affected her chest. She died one year later weighing 6 stone when i last saw her. Another friend it effected her eyes. She had operation. When it first happened she thought she had an eye infection. But when hours after hercsecond jab. She looked back through her diary it was hours later her eyes went blood red in the white area. I thought the government wanted to cull the people. U have no idea whii thought that.. but i didn't take any jabs.. 3 weeks later
0/0	I didn't get a single shot! Thank goodness my doctor stopped me from taking it.
0/0	I didn't get it but still get called a conspiracy theorist by friends when I say why. I guess we'll be waiting awhile for the apology...
0/-1	I didn't get sick with corona and I didn't get vaccinated, and I'm happy with my choice
0/0	I didn't get the COVID vaccine because I knew it was poison to the body, hated wearing the mask at work because each time I exhaled it'd fog up my glasses. I even had to wear my mask outside. Outside, no joke. I knew that only 5% of deaths were directly from COVID.
0/0	I didn't get the shot .. who else is with me ?
0/0	I didn't get vaccinated. I just didn't believe something developed that fast could be trustworthy.
0/0	I didn't take it either, and have no regrets about not taking it.
0/-1/0	I didn't trust their word when they were president. Why would I trust it after?
1/1	I didn't vaccinate my kids and the ones that lived turned out fine!
0/0	I didnt take any covid jabs and im fine. Those that did played roulette with their health. The chickens have come home to roost. Why did fauci have to be protected with a pardon? @T5Zplayer
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I didn’t even take the flu shot so imma respectfully decline covid vaccine shot. If you feel like you need it then do what you gotta do. I’m not saying don’t get. I’m just saying I’m healthy and feel I don’t need it.
0/0	I didn’t get a single shot because I just didn’t trust it.
0/-1	I didn’t get any of them. I’m not a non vax completely but didn’t get any Covid vax at any point.
0/0	I didn’t get the jab. Tested positive for Covid twice. Wasn’t terrible.I had friends and family get the jab…they all got Covid. And my sister-in-law can no longer take hikes…she gets winded after a few hundred yards. She used to hike for miles…in Colorado. I’m glad wife and I didn’t get the jab.
0/0	I didn’t get vaxxed and I watched people die around me who did.
1/1	I didn’t hesitate to get it, got a little sore on the arm for the first couple days but felt nothing besides that.
1/1	I didn’t know much about vaccines before, but after doing some research, I found out they significantly reduce the risk of severe illness.
0/0	I didn’t take the Kool aid and I feel bad for the ones who were tricked into taking it.
0/0	I didn’t vax my four children and I personally would never roll the dice w my most precious babies.
0/0	I didn’t want it. Was forced to get it. And have suffered terrible pneumonia I got from a 3 year old because of the jab. It’s an awful deadly vaccine.
1/1	I didn’t want to spread it to others. Easy decision to get vaccinated
0	I didn’t. My lady is a hair stylist/beautician/or whatever term they use in your area. She had 8 clients who did take the jab. 4 are now deceased. 2 others spent lengthy stays in the hospital. One of which had severe reactions and her muscular system shut down for 3 days. As for me and my house, we trust in herd immunity and God!
0/-1	I died because there was a pandemic of tbe unvaxxed.
0/0/1	I do NOT regret not getting the c virus vaccine, pcr tests , or flu vaccines THANK YOU JESUS ❤
1/1	I do agree that vaccines does not 100% protect you, but they can help you to get over it quicker
1/1	I do believe in the vaccine!
1/1	I do feel is safe. As a health worker i feel confident. No reaction here and everything was perfect. None of my coworkers had any side effects. Why the media is putting fear to our communities?
1/1	I do feel they are safe. There have been too many deaths due to covid already..... The ICU units and the staff cannot keep up. My children deal with covid positive patients every day in hospital. We are grateful they are getting their vaccines this week to protect themselves, their patients and families.
1/-1	I do it to protect my family
1/1	I do it to protect my patients
1/1/1	I do know! I had it before i was vaccinated and had it again after. I felt much better after being vaccinated. I believe in science and work in Healthcare.
0/-1	I do not believe that COVID-19 is a serious disease
0/0	I do not think vaccination is good, because pharmaceutical companies make huge profits from the epidemic and the public interest is ignored.
0/0	I do not want the vaccine until the FDA can tell what the permanent side effects you get that mix with others, ect
1/1	I do plan on getting the vaccine though. I want the world to go back to normal asap
1/1	I do remember what a non science believer was called in school. An F. So much ignorance out there. Only reason all of us are alive is due to advances in medicine and vaccines. Get some more education before you comment on something you have no credentials for. Helloooo.
1/0	I do want to get vaccinated, but I’m more afraid of the long term consequences that are still unknown. It’s a new vaccine, there’s sure to be something in the future
1/-1	I do wish that COVID would end
1/1	I do! I haven't gotten covid yet and I really want to keep it that way, or at least make it not as bad if I do.
1/1	I do! I work in the healthcare industry and I can't wait to get it!
1/1	I do, I get the flu shot every year alongside it
1/1	I do. I get them yearly now
1/1	I do. I get them yearly now, just like the flu shot, as soon as they're available in my area. I'd rather have a sore arm for a few days than the actual virus
1/-1	I do. I have underlying illnesses.
0/0	I don&#39;t even want to hear the muffled mask lecture - makes me sick to my stomach to see idiots like that.
0/0	I don't believe in this thing at all; I trust my gut instinct.
1/0	I don't believe in vaccination, but I vaccinated because of a legal obligation or to avoid certain restrictions
0/0	I don't believe in virus anymore, they just doing vaccine business.its our own choice whether to jab it or not-LEAVE US ALONE.
0/0	I don't belive in science, doctors...anymore. i don"t want that poison.
0/1	I don't bother personally, I have a pretty good immune system. I got the first two, and then got another round 6 months later, and then didn't bother after. I don't bother with the flu shot either usually. I just caught covid actually two weeks ago so I should be good with the antibodies for awhile. Unless you have a weak immune system or risk complications for getting it, I don't think it's needed, but it's up to everyone's comfort level. When I did have it recently, if i had to go in public I wore a mask to be kind and try not to spread it around.
1/1	I don't care what others say. I support vaccines.
0/0	I don't care what they say about risk over benefits. Where are all the trials that prove this thing has no long term effects. Oh that's right they're are none.
0/0	I don't care what you say. Not taking them. That's my choice not societies
1/-1	I don't feel sorry for anyone who doesn't get vaccinated, then gets covid or a loved one, and then says that they were wrong and should've gotten the vaccine, but guess what? Its too late for these people. Keep laughing it up out there, because sooner or later covid WILL find you
0/0	I don't know anyone I trust whos had the vaccine does having the vaccine make them an expert and answer every question I have ... lol didn't think so
1/1	I don't know if I'm the luckiest man alive or this vaccine did its job. My kids just got over having covid and somehow I didn't catch it even though I took care of them with no mask on.
0/-1	I don't know if the vaccine works, but the healthcare system is going to be crushed by it anyway.
1/1	I don't know one person who had any damage from the vaccine. These comments may be bots
0/-1	I don't know where you are from, but vaccination is not changing anything where I live. Almost the entire country as taken their restriction out, but québec is adding some
1/1	I don't know which brought me more joy - you being fully vaxxed or your bright, beautiful smile.
1/-1	I don't know why they give these people the air time.
0/0	I don't know why we believe the politicians!!!
0/0	I don't know why you would get the jab, if it didn't prevent COVID. ( Common sense to me )
1/0	I don't like that the vaccine was given emergency use authorization; it feels like it wasn't tested enough.
0/0/0	I don't like the idea of injecting something with mRNA into my body. It feels unnatural.
1/-1	I don't listen to anybody who talks about a certain field of work that they are uneducated in. Go do your full time job and crack on, do your field and leave this field.
0/0	I don't need the first dose! And leave our kids alone.
0/0	I don't need this crap in my body!
1/1	I don't see millions of people dying from vaccines. I'm vaccinated and I'm in my best condition.
1/1	I don't see why we can't just take the same vaccine in fall and spring. They wouldn't need to develop 2 per year, just let us take the same one again so we are protected for more of the year.
0/0	I don't think doctors and scientists should underestimate the publics ability to judge what's right for them by not being fully transparent. Full transparency is better for science, scientists and the public, always!!
0/0	I don't think its just the clot issue, I have never had acne or pimples in life and after vaccination I started having them which I thought maybe they are coming late or some temp effect of vaccination but even after more than 2 years of vaccination I have to take medication otherwise it increases a lot like my entire face gets swollen
0/0	I don't think the uptake was that high. At least I hope not. None of my kids (4) their spouses (3), my grandkids (6) ever even considered that shot. Two of my kids lost jobs over not taking it. One had to do weekly testing for over a year.

0/0	I don't trust the rushed vaccine development.
1/1	I don't understand why everyone is hating on the vaccine. I'm not old enough for this. Is NASA faking the vaccine in order to kill the old people, is the government a bunch of cannibals that eat you when you die? Why are we so angry about this? Don't all vaccines have side effects? I though they were a good thing.
1/-1	I don't understand why vaccination clouds the judgement of so many people who are otherwise logical

1/1	I donated to COVAX. Global vaccination is the only way out.
0/0	I dont know what the side effects will be, it hasnt been tested long enought , don't know what is in it and if VACCINE makes me ill or kills me We cannot sue. Pfizer and moderna have total immunity from liability.
0/-1	I dont need hard sell tactics. I just want available statistics, and if they don't know, DON'T GUESS!
1/1	I dont regret getting the COVID vaccine.
1	I dont regret getting the vaccine as well.
0/0	I dont think we know enough to "trust" the vaccine...we need to decide whether or not we "trust" the government that is trying to push the vaccine on us and that is a very shaky subject.
1/0	I dont understand why anyone would want to get sick and risk getting others sick by not getting the vaccine. Youve made a good decision, i would hope you're parents would understand. Good luck.
0/0	I don’t believe anything anymore it might be a trick, next one when they say this is ok, so people will trust them then they run to let it to do, but how do we trust anything that it’s our life involves

1/1	I don’t care if I get a mild case of Covid but I definitely don’t want to be one of the people who suffer long term consequences. So anything that prevents that, especially if it’s just an insignificant booster shot is more than worth it to me.

0/0	I don’t know one unvaccinated person that died from Covid and it’s 2023 I’m healthy asf and never got 1 dose of the vaccine
1/-1	I don’t know those who have lost their loved ones to COVID will endure watching this.
0/-1	I don’t know why I waste my time looking for a YouTube video about what’s in the covid vaccines, it’s not like they will actually tell the truth…
1/1	I don’t know why everyone thinks this is a government thing. The government didn’t make the vaccine, virologist, immunologists, microbiologists…. They made the vaccines all over the world. They were funded by the world, not just the US. The government purchased them. All governments purchased them in order to save lives and money. It’s hard to be a government when it’s not functioning and people are dying.
0	I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted for stating the truth. A vast majority of the population got conned into taking a vaccine that wasn’t necessary - children in particular. A lot of people are struggling to come to terms with the fact that they’ve been lied to, and there’s nothing they can do. Damage is done. Best thing to do is move forward and become the healthiest version you can be
1/1	I don’t know. I’ve been vaccinated since I was a kid back in the mid sixties. What’s all the distrust with vaccines?

1/1	I don’t understand anti-vaccine at ALL.
1/1	I don’t understand why anyone would NOT want to be vaccinated against COVID or anything.
0/0	I don’t understand why anyone would get multiple jabs. Sounds like a recipe for disaster.
0/0	I don’t understand why this is happening. Essentially the vaccinated can still spread the virus. They are walking asymptotic carriers (such as a healthy individual with a strong immune system would have little to no symptoms when sick). It’s an illusion to think you’re safe just because someone got a jab that doesn’t prevent transmission. Getting booster shots will not end this. Its absurdity.
1/1	I don’t understand why this is such a scary thing for people, just get the vaccine. If you can’t because of certain circumstances encourage others so you encourage others so there’s here immunity.

0/0	I don’t want to put foreign substances into my body without knowing the full effects.
0/0	I doubt side effects will start to arise two years after getting the vaccine. It's just that your vaccine is completely useless at stopping COVID.
0/0	I dunno. Putting "harmless viruses" with segnents of genetic code attached to them into my body for the purpose of programming my own sacred cells to manufacture antigens mimicing spike proteins of an alleged novel coronavirus which some of my other cells recognize as harmful invaders and attack sounds a little worrisome. How many of my cells are going to produce how many of these antigens? No chance of this running amok is there?
1/1	I encourage everyone to #GetVaccinated to save lives!

1/1	I ended up getting the Pfizer because it was the first available. Still glad I got it but the side effects for me were worse than when I actually had the coronavirus in the fal
1/1	I ended up with mild symptomatic Covid (body aches, muscle weakness, sore throat, etc) but not hospitalized due to these vaccines.
1/1	I enjoy living past the age of 3
0/0	I essentially don't want to be a guinea pig. I prefer to take a vaccine that has gone through high standards and safeguards in testing and production. I quickly looked up info on the polio vaccine and it seems that the first trials started in 1935 but the US didn't begin vaccinating in ernest until 1954. And then I read about the Cutter incident and I become even more wary of taking a fast-tracked vaccine. I believe in science but I also know that human error occurs.
0/0	I experienced CARPA anaphylaxis to the Moderna vax. I already had antibodies to PEG....who knew? I was out cold within an hour of receiving the shot. In the following days my immune system went into raging overdrive with painful joints, unrelenting headache, and blood pressure into the stroke range. I am left vaccine injured and unable to take medicines with PEG including IV fluids, or to use products containing PEG, try to find personal care products that do not contain it, and have to eat a special diet careful to exclude any possibility of PEG and other similar allergens. I had already reacted to four flu shots in the past and even though I always reported the reactions the party line answer was always, You must have been sick when you received the flu shot. I reported this to the vaxers and received the same party line answer to why I got sick with the flu shot. Turns out I am allergic to polysorbate 60 and 80....there's an allergy test that will steal your health. I was not observed longer with the Moderna shot even though I self reported a potential issue. I made it home in time to collapse in my home alone. This is not RARE if you are the victim. Moderna was responsive at first, but now they have upgraded their computers and my report number no longer exists. Allergists and immunologists are using this data to say it is safe to take MNRA vaccines. Paxlovid and monoclonal antibodies contain my allergens....no safe treatments for me if I get sick. The medical staff was woefully untrained to deal with special circumstances. Scientists' pleas to find alternatives to PEG on the CDC and NIH sites were ignored.
0/0	I experienced mild side effects after vaccination, which made me hesitant about boosters.

1/1	I feel a sense of solidarity knowing many of us are working together to combat COVID-19.
1/1	I feel bad for all the people who spent lots of time creating a wonderful invention to save millions of lives, eradicate diseases and expand our knowledge, only to have millions of people dumber than anyone could possibly imagine, dedicate their lives to undoing as much progress as possible.

I would rather die than promote something that hurt just 1 person. How do you go to bed at night? We all know the truth, don't make yourself look the way you do!!
1/1	I feel healthier and more energetic after vaccination.
0/0	I feel like all three of the Covid vaccinations have been rushed. I want to hear about the side effects to the first people who have taken them. From the volunteers who did a trial with this, I haven’t heard anything positive.
1/0	I feel like attracting some troll accounts so I can exercise my block finger. Here goes... COVID mRNA vaccines are overwhelmingly, though not perfectly, safe and effective. They have prevented countless deaths, and are still able to reduce the probability of symptomatic disease.
1/1	I feel like if vaccines were discussed in this context more, so many more people would vaccinate. The breakdown of all known side effects would help confused parents see the true benefits of vaccines. Comparing the infections of the past with the prevention of the present would do more then any pro vaccine argument today uses. It’s hard to compare a 1 in a million chance of allergic reaction when the disease itself seems 1 in a million. The reality is that it truly isn’t, and the chances of death or serious permanent injury is far larger than any vaccine could ever do to you. Vaccinate.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I feel like listening to any anti-vaxxer is BEYOND frustrating when you are from a third world country, rejecting vaccines comes from their privilege of living in a developed country that we most certainly don't have
1/1	I feel like looking at it from a workers rights perspective can be really helpful. I didn't want to catch covid from work. I work with the public, and coworkers. It is my right to be safe at work.

1/1	I feel nothing after both doses of Pfizer, just a little bit sore arm for 2 days. That's all.
1/1	I feel pretty glad to be working for a hospital org that announced they were requiring vaccines nearly 2 months ago. Doesn’t go into full effect until September to give people time to get both doses but still.
0/0	I feel regret too. Now that the official authorities are beginning to share the truth, just wait until you read about what doctors like Ana Maria Mihalcea and others on substack have been finding about.

0/0	I feel sorry for all young people that have been vaccinated since it is now obvious from the Israel case that it's useless.. but the most important is that pharma and test makers made a lot of money...
0/0	I feel sorry for the people who actually fell for it.. including some of my own friends and family members.

0/-1	I feel sorry for these pro-vaccine people. They're the definition of "useful idiots"
0/0	I feel sorry for thoes who think they had to take the jab to keep there job or school attendance or any mandated pourpose but if everyone stood together they could not have forced it on anyone. But it's not to late to join in the fight with all the protest against mandatory vaccination.
0/0	I feel sorry for those taking the vaccine, they don't know any better

1/1	I feel the whole world needs to be vaccinated and we should do our best to achieve this other wise it will never be in control
1/1	I feel very lucky to live in a country where I was able to protect my children from these horrible diseases. Unless we put these anti vaccine people smack dab in the middle of these countries suffering from these diseases, they will never understand. So tragic.
0/0/0/0	I feel vindicated for adamantly refusing the covid vaccine.

0/-1	I figured I put Jesus first he will take care of the rest and hasn't let me down yet.
1/1	I finally got my first dose of Pfizer. It’s been 4 days, but so far so good! I had no bad side effects, just sleepy. That was it. Slept all day the day i got it and i was good.
1/1	I finally went and got my jab today. I have so many phobias, but I did it for my Louisiana peeps. There were about 8-10 people at the CVS getting their first jab, as well. Maybe we aren't as stupid as we are slow and lazy, but today we did it! Yay us!
1/1	I finished my Pfizer vaccination a few weeks ago and I feel like I have the weight of the world off of my shoulders.
1/1	I firmly believe in Darwinism. You are simply gunning for that Darwin award if you don't vaccinate. It seems these days people are so paranoid and hateful they are willing to die or kill others for it.
1	I for my first dose and nothing weird happen yet 8 hours in (Pfizer vaccine)
1/-1	I found it a moving and, in part, shocking film. I knew that many people were not getting the vaccination for a variety of mistaken beliefs, but I didn't know that vaccination uptake was so slow by medical staff. How can this be?
1/1	I fully intend to get my child (due in next few weeks) every vaccine that is recommended by her pediatrician.
0/0	I gave in to the pressure here in Germany and got vaccinated three times, once with serious complications afterwards. I still got infected with Covid three times and have this so-called "long Covid" since then. I think it's a side effect of the vaccine, but nobody here cares.
1/1	I get a covid and flu shot every year. I have to pay $50 for the covid shot, cause my insurance doesn't cover it. Its worth every penny.
1/1	I get a flu shot every year, which means I might as well get the covid one while I'm there too.
1	I get both, flu and Covid shots each year
1/1	I get both, flu and Covid shots each year. I’d rather do everything I can to reduce my symptoms if I happen to catch either, because I hate being sick.
1/1	I get every cold/covid shot that offered, you wanna get terribly sick go for it.
0/0	I get flu vaccine every year. My kid has all vaccines growing up. I will not be taking the covid vaccine for at least 5 years. It’s rushed and comparatively untested. Also there has never ever been an rna antivirus approved for human use. It may be fine. But only by accident. This isn’t how medicines should be developed

1/-1	I get headaches and take ibuprofen, it doesn't always work, but I like the chances I have when it does.
0/-1	I get headaches, extreme fatigue, body aches, and fever up to 104F when I get covid shots. It's exactly like having the flu but it only lasts 24-36 hours. After I get my covid shots I have to go home within the next 4ish hours because after that I'm too exhausted to be able to drive, and then I usually sleep for 12 ish hours that night, and then lay in bed all the next day feeling like ass
1/1	I get my 1st Friday. I am doing for my grandma who passed from COVID in November. I’m doing it cause she didn’t get a chance to.
1/1	I get my 2nd jab this Friday – – whoo-hoo! If I get any reactions, I’ll know it’s just my immune system going through a dress rehearsal for defending me from the real virus.
1/1/1/1/1	I get my Covid booster and flu vaccine at the same time, every year. I still have yet to contract Covid.
1/1/1	I get my first next week! As a school worker I am very excited!
1/1	I get my second dose August the 10th, and I’m happy to do my part. Even though in the US after vaccination you no longer have to wear a mask, but I’ll continue to wear mine even though I’m vaccinated. Just common currency.
1/1	I get really emotional thinking about how much we are capable of solving huge problems if we really put our minds to it. Very grateful to all the scientists, researchers, health workers, and so many more people, who have put in such a tremendous amount of hard work into developing and distributing vaccines in record time.
1/1	I get so angry that people who refuse to get vaccinated are just prolonging the pandemic and will end up making it worse because the thing will mutate to something we don't have a vaccine for! It is really hard for me to understand this!
1/1	I get that he changed, but this perfectly demonstrates the mindset of "It's your problem until it happens to me" that many anti vaxers have.
1/1	I get that people are scared, but come on—scientists, doctors, experts all say it's safe. I trust them more than some random guy on Facebook. 📚
1/1	I get that some people think it’s a risk, but it felt riskier to leave myself unprotected.
1/-1	I get the boosters every year.
1/1	I get the flu shot every year, so I get the Covid one too. Why risk getting sick? Everyone in my family gets one, and I see people (especially older people) getting Covid shots at the pharmacy.
1/0	I get the impression that this woman is motivated by vanity and attention as opposed to concern for the health of other people
1/-1	I get them. I have an autoimmune disorder, and I'm not taking a chance considering how caliver or downright wrong people are about Covid. The numbers have dropped for a range of reasons including many people are stupid and don't care about the people around them. I'm doing what I can to make sure that I don't get it...again.
1/1	I get vaccinated every year for Flu (I am asthmatic and it is Free for people with Moderate to Severe Asthma in the UK). On a couple of occasions I suffered a mild stomach upset shortly after the vaccination appointment. Recently, I actually caught the Flu, as the standard Flu Vaccine used in the UK (like all Vaccines) is good but not 100% foolproof. And honestly, I will take a quick injection and potential (short term) stomach upset over Flu any day.
1/1	I go the first dose of the Moderna vaccine last night. Yay! My arm is sore, but still, yay! #vaccine #getthatshot #Moderna

1/1	I got 2 doses. I'm not afraid of needles. ;)
0/0	I got 3 jabs in 2021 because I was told I needed them the cross the border. I am an American living in Canada and I missed my family so much, hadn’t seen them in over a year since the border was closed, so I got the jabs. May 2023 I was diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer: no history of cancer in my family. I’m starting to think it was the vaccines.

1/1	I got Covid here in Denmark as well while fully vaccinated. My partner isn’t vaccinated (yet) and their symptoms were way worse than mine. I’m grateful for being vaccinated before I got Covid!!
1/1	I got Covid in New years 2021 and lost my smell and taste for a week. Got the vaccine. Got Covid again later that year and it was just a slight cold. I haven't gotten sick in 2 1/2 years; just mild symptoms like a runny nose. My immune system ROCKS now!
0/-1	I got Covid once and didn’t affect like that I guess my system was good but my mom and grandma got the vaccine2-3 times and they got Covid 2-3 times

1/1	I got both Pfizer vaccines and I never had a single problem other than a sore arm the next day. This was about 3 months ago now. My entire family except my grandpa (who got Moderna’s instead) got Pfizer and was perfectly fine. My grandpa who got the Moderna vaccine actually had a fever and a headache for a few days but was fine afterwards.

They were sick for nearly 6 weeks. They both barely survived. My grandpa has to get a new hip because of it.
1/1	I got both doses of the vaccine and I'm here to reassure everyone reading this that it's okay, the most that ever happened to me was a light fever on the day after getting the second dose but other than that I'm completely fine. If you're afraid of needles, I promise it barely heards at all, and this is coming from someone who is terrified of needles. Please get vaccinated if you haven't yet, it will really help everyone and bring our lives back to normal sooner
1/1	I got both flu and Covid vaccinations two weeks ago. I usually don't have much of a reaction but one or both of these shots kicked my ass for an entire week. I can only imagine what the illness itself might do, so I'm really glad to have this layer of protection

1/1	I got both of my vaccines. The first covid shot was a piece of cake. The second shot made me feel drained and fatigued for 2 days. I have no regrets about getting my covid shots. It has given me a sense of relief. Although its not 100% it is 95% and I would rather have that than 0%.
1/1	I got both shots of pfizer. I got covid about 5 months later and was short of breath and couldn’t stop coughing nonstop for about a week. I’m lucky I’m extremely active and healthy. I had a tenant who was unvaccinated, he was 24 and healthy, a little heavy for his age like 70% of us. He knew he was sick but thought he would would just work through it, he ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for several days, almost died. His girlfriend was almost due to have their baby. I urge everyone to get the vaccine I’m glad I did. I may not be here if I hadn’t.
0/0	I got covid after the vaccine, what a joke.
0/0	I got covid and survived, no vaccine needed.
0/0	I got covid before Vax was available . I was sick for about 5 days , recovered, and returned to work as a nurse . When I returned, my unit manager informed me that Vax would be mandated regardless of natural antibodies . I finished my shift , called HR, and retired . I worked 33 years and felt so strongly that something was off about the Vax. I couldn't shake it . My 2 best friends both took Vax and boosters . Now, both are battling very aggressive cancers .
0/0	I got covid from the vaccine. Dont believe anything these people say.
1/1	I got covid in March. I wear a mask in public but had several dental appointments so that is the most likely place I may have picked it up. Took Paxlovid. Was sick for 2 weeks but got through it with OTC meds. I got a covid vaccine in Sept. Now I am hearing the CDC will be recommending another vaccine after 6 months for elderly and immunocompromised people. I will be first in line.
0/0	I got covid in November 2020. I did not take the experimental gene therapy shot. Since then I have not been sick while people around me that got that shot have gotten covid at least one more time if not more. I'm in my mid 50s also. I up my vitamin d every winter which I believe contributes to me not getting sick

1/-1	I got it between my first & second shots...during lockdown.
0/0	I got it in Jan 2021. I've had uncontrollable inflammation starting 2 weeks after the 2nd shot. I am now on Prednisone as needed. My healthy 58 y.o. brother died of a sudden heart attack. His heart was inflamed. I've also now had Covid 3 times. People need to go to jail.
0/0	I got it in solidarity with my wife who is a healthcare worker and we both deeply regret it.
1/0	I got it, plus the flu vaccine, hep B, and the shingles shots. I'm pretty disappointed I haven't started glowing yet.

1/1	I got mine with my flu shot, and took my kids to get theirs as well.Im super sensitive to all vaccines, but this year was pretty mild for me.
1/1	I got mine yesterday at the Veterans Administration along with a flu shot. There was a long line of us.
1/1	I got mine yesterday with my flu shot. They hit me pretty hard but still better than getting sick with either virus 😸
1/1	I got mine! Let my fear of needles get in the way but not anymore. I’m fine, not dead, everyone should get it.
1/1	I got mine. Two weeks after I got my booster, my wife and kids all got COVID. I never developed symptoms and never tested positive. n=1 so it’s meaningless in the grand scheme but I’m a believer.
1/1	I got moderna 3 days ago. I am fully satisfied with my decision
0/-1	I got my 2024 COVID vaccine on Tuesday morning—my arm didn't start hurting until last (Wednesday) night. Today I feel terrible. Could this still be a reaction to the vaccine? Seems a bit delayed, no?
1/1/1	I got my 2nd booster 4 days ago! 😁👍❤
1/1	I got my 5th COVID-19 booster shot on Friday. The day I become a science and vaccine denier please shoot my foolish selfish self. We have a duty to protect those around us, whether it be family, friends or a total stranger

1/1/1	I got my COVID and flu shot together. No side effects at all.

1/1	I got my booster and feel much safer now. Highly recommend it to everyone
1/1	I got my booster shot today. First two doses were AstraZeneca, third was Pfizer. Unlike the last two times, there was a queue and the head nurse kept calling people and trying to reschedule appointments to avoid wasting 2 doses. Don't get me wrong: I'm beyond excited for this technology, but we really need to do something about the vaccines' shelf life, storage conditions, etc.
0/0	I got my booster(Moderna) 2 weeks ago and i still suffer from pain in my left chest and fatigue. Before the booster i was superfit and had no infection for 5 years... I am 34.
1/1	I got my booster, and it was no big deal. Felt a little tired, but that’s it. Totally worth it for the peace of mind.
1/1	I got my first Pfizer yesterday. Boy does my arm hurt! I'm a very tiny 65 year old lady and I guess the shots are all the same regardless of your size. I ache all over but it's not a big deal. I look forward to the 2nd shot for full immunity. Folks we need to get this done.
1/1	I got my first dose on Monday and only have a bit of arm pain. I’m 18. Can’t wait for 2nd dose.
1/1/1/1/1	I got my first dose today and that’s really good

1/1	I got my first shot 3 weeks ago and I’m about to get my 2nd one in exactly 30 mins I’ll update later. Update: Just got it around an hour ago only side effect so far is a sore arm and that’s it. Day 2: sore arm is petty bad Day 3: the sore arm has gotten better but now I have a really stuffy nose. Day 4 I can’t feel the pain in my arm any more and the stuffy nose has gotten better 2 Months Later: Sorry I forgot to update you guys for awhile. Anyway I’m fine and the shot wasn’t bad at all. The only things were a sore arm and stuffy nose and that’s it. I’m tired of this naysayers. 4 months later: I came across this video on my recommendation page and I completely forgot I got the shot so yeah still alive after visiting a different continent. The vaccine works. Happy 4th of July! 6 months later: yep still here and alive 7 months later: still alive 9 months later yep still alive
1/1	I got my first shot today! I have anxiety about shots and one woman in the group had to stare at the floor because seeing someone getting a shot makes her feel nausea. Applause to us and every other person that had to really push through some mental barriers to get vaccinated and bravely did anyway
1/1	I got my first shot yesterday. Only reasons I didn’t sooner is a) I cannot drive because I’m blind, and 2) my mom is paranoid and wouldn’t give me a ride
1/1	I got my first two doses in December last year, and thankfully I felt as if I didn't have the vaccine.
1/1	I got my flu and Covid booster two months ago . I deal with the public all day and live with my elderly father , so being anti vax is not an option .
1/1	I got my latest vaccine about a month ago. Then my first shingles vaccine. Then a mild case of shingles. Next is the flu shot. COVID is still very much an issue and I'd do everything I could to avoid getting it.
1/1	I got my second COVID 19 vaccination yesterday Friday 4/2/21. And yes, I spent a large portion of Saturday 4/3/21 in bed with side effects. I've had problems with joint pain (shoulders and elbows) since this vaccination process got started in March, but it is my understanding it is not as common. Thanks for the information.
1/1	I got my second does and it was just a little chills , tiny fever and it just went away by 48 hours. Im so happy to have been vaccinated~ I can now teach my students in person!!

1/1	I got the Pfizer vaccine and never had any side effects, but getting the booster, I'm not sure which to choose, so this helped me make an educated decision. Thanks!
0/0	I got the Pfizer vaccine less than 24 hours ago I already have flu like symptoms and a bad headache. Did I just make the worst mistake of my life I feel they injected covid in my body
1/1	I got the Pfizer vaccine, and it was a smooth experience. My side effects were just a sore arm and mild fatigue for a day. Totally worth it!
1/1	I got the Pfizer vaccine. Had a sore arm that lasted a few hours and was gone next morning.
1	I got the astrazeneca vaccine last week, I feel good (as always), my body is not overreacting at all, no fatigue or aches at all, not even coughs too. I'm glad it's boosting my immune cells still.

1/1	I got the booster yesterday and feel great! No side effects!
1/1	I got the covid even though im fully vaccinated but what i can assure you..it makes me sick but not any worse, my athmatic wife has it like nothing. So get your vaccines people!

1/1	I got the double vaccine, and every booster. Not only am I PERFECTLY FINE but my blood has antibodies that can save someone, with COVID-19 who needs transfusion. You want to go antivax, your right to do so, just don't complain if you die from a disease that has a vaccine
0/-1	I got the first Moderna shot and have no reaction. But the second shot and booster shot I got, I have sore arm, chills and fever for 12 hours. Very much lying on bed for a whole day.
0/0	I got the first Moderna shot, guilted into it because of my sick fiancee, by the nurse and pharmacist at Walmart when I stopped by to pick up his insulin.<br><br>It made me so sick I didn&#39;t come back in 30 days for the follow up shot.<br><br>Last week I ended up in the ER, cat scan, possible MS.<br><br>I have all the symptoms and it shows up on scan.<br><br>What do I do now?
0/0	I got the first Moderna vaccine and my heart started flipping out for about two weeks. Two weeks later I was hesitant but got the second dose and my heart flipped out worse for about 10 months but then advanced into full blown chest pain. PCP and cardiologist both say my heart is just fine. Sorry folks my heart has never felt this way before so I’m not buying what you’re selling. Can we say “lost faith in the medical industry”!!!!!
0/0	I got the first dose and felt awful. Not doing it again.
0/-1	I got the first shot of Sinopharm and I am always feeling tired and sleepy after the vaccine, Now I took at least 14 hours sleep in a day but before vaccination I was hardly sleep only for 8 hours
1/1	I got the first shot yesterday and feel fine

1/1	I got the first two doses of Moderna 1 1/2 years ago, I get blood work done by my general practitioner and I’m actually healthier now than I have ever been but I also exercise every day and eat well. It’s your choice to take it but be wary of ignorant people in the YouTube comments that will tell you that the shot is going to do something horrible to you. The fear surrounding COVID and vaccines are significantly worse than the disease itself.
1/1	I got the first two... but more because I didn't want to get vulnerable relatives sick than myself.
1/1	I got the flu and newest COVID vaccs a couple months ago— luckily my work offered them on site!

0/0	I got the shot and still felt like crap when I got COVID.
1/1	I got the shot, and I feel great
0/0	I got the shot, but I’m still not convinced it’s doing anything. I still wear a mask everywhere just to be safe.
1/1	I got the shot, got exposed twice by people that told me later they had it and felt the shitty symptoms and i didn't get it.
0/0	I got the vaccine a few years ago because my parents decided the whole family should, but now when I think about it, it is very suspicious and I 100% regret getting it (they were fear mongered by the media). Now I'm scared there are going to be some long-term effects because of it (infertility) or other issues. I don't know if I'm going crazy but I have never felt so much regret in my life.
0/0	I got the vaccine and I still got COVID... twice. Someone explain that to me? 😒
1/1	I got the vaccine and no infertility, had a kid before and after.
1/1	I got the vaccine and on the second one I did feel a little sick for a couple of days. However, it is part of the training of the immune system for if someone gets the virus, I think. This virus caused a downfall to the world, and it is so sad to see people being sick with this virus. I just hope that everything goes back to normal one day.
0/0	I got the vaccine and still got COVID, what's the point?

1/-1	I got the vaccine in April and still got covid in august I’m on day 4 of the virus and my Symptoms are minimal. My only annoying symptom is the loss of taste and smell. I’m not sure if the vaccine has helped with the symptoms but you still can get sick even vaccinated. My wife also got sick and she is vaccinated.

0/0	I got two doses of covishield, before that i was a healthy person. Never even needed to take medicine. After the vaccine, i now have the problem of sudden heartbeat increase, pain in heart and fever, all of these together.

0/0	I got very injured from my first Covid vaccine. I was sent to the ER 20 mins after my injection. I passed out, had a horrible fever. This is real.
1/1	I got whooping cough before I could get my vaccine but because everyone around me was vaccinated it didn’t spread
1/1	I grew up in a “normal” house and when I was 9 I crawled under my house to follow my cat. I put my hand down on a rusty nail sticking up out of the ground and literally impaled myself. Thank goodness I had a Pediatritian for a mom who made me get my vaccines!
1/1	I grew up with vaccines since the 60's so i'm not afraid of them like the people who read bullshit posts on here.
1/1	I guess I'm one of the half of the Americans that want to get this vaccine.
0/0	I guess I’ll be searching for a new profession very soon lol. YOU WILL NOT FORCE ME TO DO ANYTHING………….
1/1	I guess a vaccine is now political... Just take it! Do it for your country if you love it so much!
0/0/0	I guess health officials missed it that can cause aids and people died and cause death guess they don't want anybody knowing about this
1/-1	I guess if your older 🤷 it's better because you die
1/-1	I guess something good came from all of this.
1/1	I guess we know who gave a thumbs down. As someone with an autoimmune disease I appreciate anyone who gets vaccinated. Their choice puts others at risk.

1/1	I had 3 covid vaccines thanks to the VA. Still here
1/-1	I had 3 covid vaccines, got it before hand and had it several times since about once a year.. Any studies of how reinfection affects you long term? Seems studies are around vaccinated vs unvaccinated, but nothing around repeat infections after vaccination.. Are you protected long term from vaccinations and covid's side effects? Am I gonna end up with -10 IQ in about 20 years time?? 🤣
1/1	I had 5 vaccines and I have been fine.
1/1/1/1/1/1	I had COVID a couple years ago. Almost certainly due to Pfizer vaccination it was not much worse than a bad cold. Meanwhile an anti-vax coworker my age, same profession, named Tom died of COVID a couple years ago.
0/0	I had COVID and recovered just fine. Why would I need the vaccine?
0/0	I had COVID and survived. Why do I need a vaccine?
1	I had COVID before and the vaccine made my symptoms much milder.
1/1	I had COVID before my vaccine, and I never want to go through that again.
1/1	I had COVID, and honestly, it just felt like a bad cold. But even so, I’m really thankful for the vaccine. It’s given me peace of mind, and I believe it’s the best way to protect not just myself, but everyone around me.
1/1	I had COVID, and it was awful—I wish I had gotten vaccinated sooner.
1/1	I had COVID, and it was brutal. I wish I had taken the vaccine sooner. 😔
0/0	I had COVID, recovered, but was still forced to take the shot. Why?
1/-1	I had Corona (Omnicron) and I got the vaccine and I am perfectly healthy and fine. And this could also has been due to me getting the vaccene 2 years ago. But I know this is not for everyone the same.
1/-1	I had Corona, don't go telling me it's fake.
0/0	I had Covid June 2021. Had both my Pfeizer vaccines. But I'm batteling with terrible muscle aches and headaches. I was told by my GP it could take 5 month's to a year to go away. In the meantime from drinking anti inflammatories for pain it damaged my kidneys. Now I suffer daily from terrible pain.
1/1	I had Moderna shots. My booster was a half dose. I had very mild reactions to all three shots. However I felt the booster the most. I spent a day resting on the couch, drinking tea and napping. Mostly fatigue, some aches and chills. Felt 100% better the next day.
0/0	I had a backache and a headache for 2 months straight after the J&J vaccine. I’m not getting a booster after that experience.
0/0	I had a bad reaction to a vaccine. My parents didn’t want me to have vaccinations since I was 2. I am now 19 and i couldn't be more grateful to my parents for saving my life because the ideology i grew up with has saved me from covid vaccines today.
0/1	I had a bad reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine.
0/0	I had a bad reaction, but my doctor ignored me. So wrong.
0/0	I had a cousin who needed a heart transplant. He had to have the Covid vaccine to get it. Insanity!
1/1	I had a crazy bad reaction to the MMR vaccine when I was a toddler. I still get all my vaccines. It's insane to me that people feel like it's some huge risk.
1/1	I had a family member tell me the vaccine would make me infertile. The look on their face when I reminded them that I’m already infertile was priceless.
1/1	I had a great experience getting vaccinated...
0/0	I had a heart attack after my jab. I'm young fit don't drink or smoke but that wasn't enough after my jab.
0/0	I had a lot of side effects from the J&J one, and never got a booster because of it. Dizzy, black spots in vision, confusion, and a crazy circular rash that started a couple of weeks later that has spread to most of my torso and face.
1/1	I had a minor seizure-like event after receiving the pertussis vaccine in 1988 and my mother was convinced that it was a vaccine reaction and was terrified of giving me and later my sister the rest of our vaccines. Fortunately for me she still let me have all the others, just not the pertussis booster, but she insisted that we do it at the pediatrician&#39;s office and wouldn&#39;t let us get vaccines in school. I begged to be allowed to get Hep B in school with my peers in grade 6 (and she let me.) I begged to be allowed to get the TDAP booster in high school and even did some research to show her it wasn&#39;t the same vaccine as what I&#39;d been given in the 80s, but she wouldn&#39;t. When my daughter was born in 2017 I allowed her to get everything and started asking the nurses to give me a TDAP booster. I finally convinced my GP to do it in 2022, at age 34. No reaction, I was fine.
0/1	I had a professor in med school who said “ Don’t ever be the first or the last to try a medication”. I’m planning on doing exactly that.
0/0	I had a severe reaction to my socond shot.
1/1	I had a shot today, no side effects, looking forward to the second shot next month
0/0	I had a stroke after getting the shot. My life is ruined... What am I suppose to do now? No attorney will take my case...
1/1	I had all the vaccines and never got COVID either
0/0	I had an adult son who was pro vaccine who literally berated me to the point where it almost cost severe problems between us. And I never got the vaccine and I did get Covid but I survived and I’m still grateful with everything that’s coming out that I did not get the vaccine. And I will not. Thank you for sharing your story. It just confirms what I thought all along. Anything can, and probably is in that vaccine.
1/1/1	I had an upper lung lobectomy in 2018 and I caught COVID . Because of the vaccine I'm still here. BECAUSE OF THAT VACCINE I DID NOT HAVE TO GO INTO THE HOSPITAL!!! BECAUSE OF THAT VACCINE I ONLY HAD THE SNIFFLES!! Soooooo you could never, ever talk me against the vaccine because I'm still here 🤸🏾♀️ Amen 🙏🏾
0/0	I had astrazeneca i ended up in hospital with a bloodclot on my lungs, now on blood thinners for life
1/1	I had been putting off getting my vaccine (for no good reason other than I "work from home and don't need it"), and this video inspired me to finally make the appointment. Doing the good work :)
0/0	I had blood clots in my lungs because if the Covid vaccine. I will have to be on blood thinners for the rest of my life.
1/1	I had body aches after getting my covid vaccine as well as the booster and it was totally worth it. I never got covid. Better feeling aches for a few days than dying.
1/1	I had both Pfizer vaccine doses. With the second dose, I had arm soreness, mild tiredness, mild malaise. That's it. Wasn't bad at all. Most people I know who got it had a similar experience.
1/1	I had both doses of Pfizer, I had a sore arm and felt lethargic. But that’s it
0/0	I had childhood vaccines including measles, polio, etc. But none as an adult, not flu, shingles, covid. I am 70 and healthy. Never had any of those illnesses.
0/0	I had covid 19 with the symptoms, Quarantine for 10 days, I took turpentine during quarantine which tins the blood and I have asthma, it didn't affect my breathing at all, one year later I got again this time no symptoms, I never went to the doctor, 2 officers from work took the Vaccine, 2 months later they got Covid 19 and died
1/1	I had covid 3 times, but because of the vaccines I never had to go to the hospital or see a doctor when I was sick.
1/1	I had covid in Christmas 202O, before the vaccine came out and I have been battling Long Covid ever since. I have since had 5 vaccines to which I give full credit in preventing any recurrences of the illness.I live in the U S and get it every 4 or 5 months from our local Safeway Pharmacy, Absolutely no side effects and I am in my 70s.
0/-1	I had covid, so i took the vaccine bc i didnt want it again. So not sure which is messing with my health.
1/1	I had doubts at first, but the more I read about how the vaccines were developed, the more it made sense.
0/0	I had encephalitis from the polio vaccine, and GBS from flu vaccine. I was terrified to get any others
0/0	I had got my second shot, and was hospitalized for an allergic reaction to the shot. My lips were tingling and my throat was closing up shop. My first shot had mild symptoms that was treated with benadryl. Can't wait for the third shot? Maybe have another EpiPen ready and a trip to the hospital.
0/0	I had horrible side effects for weeks after taking the vaccine.
1/1	I had mild side effects, and it was worth it.
1/1	I had mild side effects, but it was nothing compared to the risk of COVID. So worth it!
1/1	I had mild side effects, but it was worth it.
1/1	I had mild side effects, but that’s nothing compared to what COVID could do
1/1	I had mild symptoms thanks to my vaccine when I got COVID.
1/1	I had mine early this afternoon. No side effects so far from the BioNTech jab.
1/1	I had minor side effects, but it's worth it to prevent COVID-19.
1/1	I had my 1st shot of AstraZeneca today. Feeling no side effect so far. I was scheduled last month but I didn't go because vaccine available was Sinovac only and I don't like that. They reschedule me for Astra Zeneca today and I'm satisfied.
1/1	I had my 2nd Pfizer shot 4 days ago, nothing happened at all. Nothing happened with my first shot either. Perfectly safe and reliable.
1/1	I had my Pfizer booster exactly 6 months after my 2nd dose and it packed a punch in terms of side effects. I would still do it, though!
1/1	I had my first dose 2 weeks ago. literally no side affects I was fine y'all r dramatic
1/1	I had my first dose of Pfizer vaccine 15 hours ago. So far I feel mild pain in the injection site and slight headache and fatigue. Update: I woke up today feeling nothing, all the side effects of the vaccine disappeared. I feel amazing today.
1/-1	I had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine last Wednesday. Some non-life threatening reactions. My doctor wanted me to get a Shingles vaccine prior to this. Do I need to wait, If so, do we know how long?
1/1	I had my first dose one week ago and when I got home I slept 14 and a half hours straight. 🤣🤣🤣
0/0	I had my first jab at the end of March.The side effects were quite severe for over a week. Had the second jab in June but not the same reaction. Now September i still have problems.Vertigo and the sensation of the brain being slightly behind when moving my head. Like being drunk and moving your head and the brain can't keep up. Lost the energy that i once had too. Wish i hadn't had the vaccine as i was a healthy fit man before the jab.
0/0/0/0/0	I had my first jab yesterday but I've been nauseous and weak ever since plus got a running stomach. As someone that hasn't fallen sick on a decade this sucks.
1/1	I had my first vaccine shot yesterday. No side effects yet. None. Feeling lucky. #CovidVaccine #OxfordAstraZeneca #COVID19Ontario https://t.co/dpTBgZz46J
0/0	I had my flu shots every year but I just don’t trust the Covid vaccine. I worked with people who got corona since March last year and never had it. I’m good with the flu shots. Thank you.
0/0	I had my moderna covid vaccine 9 days ago. I still have a burning fever every night, severe fatigue, headaches, and body aches. I'm not an antvax person either. This is my 4 th shot since 2021. I feel depressed sick and weak. I was very active 59 year old male . I dig 4 ft deep holes to plant my trees on my homestead, now all I do is sleep and watch TV. This is a nightmare.
1/1	I had my vaccinations as a kid and im still here because of them i dintnunderstand why people are acting like this is such a new thing theres vaccines that save lives
1/1	I had my vaccine 11:58am 28th September, felt fine next day, sore arm, and I started to feel tired. Been drinking Lift Plus a lot, he he. First vaccine I have had in years.
1/1	I had my vaccine today. NGL Didn't feel anything untill now
1/1	I had myocarditis after my 2nd vaccine. 56 yo female. Extremely rare for my group. 3 days in hospital. I am fine. NO regrets!
1/1	I had myocarditis and PVCs after the second COVID vaccination, which apparently is fairly rare for a middle-aged man. It resolved in a few months and subsequent vaccinations didn't cause any symptoms.
1/1	I had no clue how complex and different forms a vaccine can come in. There’s advantages and disadvantages to live attenuated vaccines, simulants and others that weren’t talked about. Simulant is effective, but is not necessarily something that is good for the long term. I feel now that I'm more knowledgeable on how vaccines work, I'm more open to getting the vaccine.
1/1	I had no side effects from vaccine.
1/1	I had not planned on getting this vaccine. My mother suffered and died from covid. I got this vaccine out of respect for my mother's suffering and because I don't want to spread this to anyone else. It's not at all about me. I got it for the good of others.
0/-1	I had one Astra-Zeneca and now I'm crippled with Guilian-Barrè syndrome. I just heard my application for VDPS has been rejected.
0/0/0	I had people trying to pressure me into getting it, happy to say I didn't.
0/0	I had people trying to pressure me into getting it, happy to say I didn't. Didn't lock down, worked everyday, didn't mask unless I had to, didn't get the poke, and still havent gotten c19 to this day that i know of, I was even around people with it. I've had a couple minor or colds that lasted like a day since 2020 and if that was it I'm severely unimpressed. We seriously wrecked our economy over a cold, it's crazy. Only old and unhealthy people should have stayed home.
1/1	I had plenty of vaccines before COVID, so I didn't mind these shots. Turns out, I'm the only one in my family who never tested positive.
0/0/0/0/0/0	I had received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. I do not plan to get anymore vaccines. I experience sone chest discomfort/fatigue/sore arm days and days on after receiving the second dose.
0/0	I had severe reactions after taking the first shot. Too much pain in my body just because it's mandatory in my country. I doubt I'll go for the shot again
0/0	I had swelling in my brain after my 2nd M0derna..AND over 10 of my patients have been diagnosed with either encephalitis brain swelling)(and encephalopathy). THAT IS NOT RARE. And it is NOT A BENEFIT that outweighed the risks for ME because I worked on the frontline and had up to 32 C0vid patients at a time and never got C0vid.
1/1	I had the Covid vaccine and all the boosters and I'm still here. Unfortunately many I know didn't get it and are no longer with us.
0/-1	I had the Johnson and Johnson one dose. Sick as a dog, shivered and froze for 4 days. Nausea, chills,drowsy. That was bad. The virus would be a lost cause.
0/0	I had the Moderna shot and got alopecia areata, took the Pfizer and both arms went numb. I stopped taking any of them, very dangerous.
1/1	I had the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine today! So grateful to be offered the vaccine. I feel absolutely fine no side effects so far!
1/1	I had the covid vaccine as a transplant patient. It had no side effects on me personally. I got covid later and it helped save my life by limiting the effect of covid 19 itself. Without the vaccine and with a shot immune system I'd most likely die.
1/0	I had the first Pfizer shot and was hospitalised in the following weeks as a result of it. Never had another shot of anything. I was not the only one hospitalised during that time.
0/0	I had the first jab, and I wish I hadn't, total peer pressure and coercion after being made to lose time ten days off work due to being in contact, despite having clear tests. The side effects of that first jab made me realize just how bad a move it was. I've lost so much faith in humanity at how this whole thing was orchestrated.
1/1	I had the first vaccine and all boosters since. I will continue to do so. Will also take all recommended vaccines
0/0	I had the jabs because to be honest i was scared we all were, after having the booster i think its 3 years now, ive never been so ill in my life! I was catching everything, feeling drained, chest was really bad all the time, id get over something then catch something else, so was my partner and son! We all decided never to have anymore and we haven&#39;t. After not getting anymore we all started to feel better, i wouldn&#39;t get anymore im 1000 percent sure they made us ill, whats in them especially for NHS staff to refuse them? Makes you think doesnt it!
1/1	I had the last booster last year at the same time as my annual flu vaccine. I’ll get the latest one this fall with my flu vaccine.
1/1	I had the moderna vaccine in a few weeks I will get the 2nd shot. It was fine it was just like the regular flue shot. I will update on the 2nd shot I'm hearing there are additional effects on the 2nd shot.
0/1	I had the similar effects although i am 45 years when it happened to me and i was perfectly fine before .
0	I had the sinofarm v an had a lot off side effects feelin exhausted, tired, bad allegies reaction, it worsen my anxiety an its a year now since i took it an still feelin sick, cant do much work as before burns out really quickly an the doctors cant find wat causin these life treatenin side effects, i sure the one who invent tis v knows, but want the people dead, god wil deal wit these wicked people trust me
1/1	I had the vaccine 2 weeks ago with zero side effects. Zero
1/0	I had the vaccine and all my t-shirts that had stains on them washed out clean. I also became very attractive and I’m no longer lactose intolerant.
1/1	I had the vaccine and didn't get sick, even when an unvaccinated person in my house did get sick. I don't regret getting it, and I know no one who got it who regrets it. But I do know a few who probably would regret not getting it because COVID-19 killed them.
1/1	I had the vaccine. No big deal! Just do it - unless your Physician advises against it. The risk and discomfort of the virus is much greater than any risk or discomfort from the vaccine!
1/1	I had the vax yesterday along with the flu jab. It is now the next morning and I'm fine
0/-1	I had the worst reaction from my second phizer vaccine and so did my partner.
0/-1	I had to go on blood thinners before taking the covid jab. do you think the air affected me?
1/1	I had vaccine Tuesday I feel fine now
1/1	I hadn’t been vaccinated in 23 years (two life threatening reactions when I was little). But I decided that the risks of COVID were high enough, and the mRNA vaccines are different enough, that I got the vaccine anyway. It went fine and now I have much more peace of mind.
0/0	I hardly ever get sick and no medical issues but expected to take some rushed sketchy vaccine? Is there a way to get out of this place?
0/0	I hate being vaccinated
0/0	I hate deceit, cause it destroy lives and society, COVID 19 vaccines is.
0/0	I hate that I was forced to do the vaccine and threatened to be fired from work. We don’t even have a say on our own health
1/1	I hate to say it, but self-interest overrides compassion in many people. They need an incentive to protect others you can't sway them with responsibility or empathy and least of all, data.
1/1	I have 17 friends and acquaintances who were killed by Covid. I have had 5 vaccines so far. I have had Covid twice. I treated it immediately with Paxlovid and was free of all symptoms in 2 days both times.
1/1/0	I have COVID-19, I've had it for 12 days, I think I'm starting to feel a bit better. I've been vaccinated so I didn't need to go to hospital or anything, It feels like having both a cold and a chest infection.
1/1	I have England over Italy tomorrow for one very important reason the Covid-19 Vaccines are safe and effective
1/1	I have MS and I had the vaccine, it didn’t affect me. I have had COVID 3 times in 3 years, I was sick but without those vaccines, I may have died.
0/0/0/0	I have Myocardises after getting my MRNA. Just waiting now for a law firm to start a class action. They lied to us.
0/0/0/0/0/0	I have PTSD from what our government did to us. I didn’t get that shot. It was a no-brainer for me. I lost friends, family, career. But no regrets.
0/0	I have Question to the company scientist and who , all government pushed to take COVID 19 vaccine, Vaccine Side effects now started people have different types of problems, but who is the Responsible? people have unexpected sins coming on hand& knees, joint pains ....please explain and who will pay the dyeing people depends?
0/0	I have Stage 4 Cancer and unvaccinated.. My trust is in The Lord and so far .. He's been hitting it out of the ballpark for me..
1/1	I have a 22 year old who will not get the vaccine. I hope I don’t pressure him but try to create a dialogue and bring the conversation up maybe twice a month.
0/0	I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. They were all healthy before getting vaccinated. I am certain that the vaccine will lead to a series of health issues
1/1	I have a dozen medical problems 3 of which could take my life at any moment, I have had all flu shots, all Covid jabs and never felt sick, never got headaches, never went whoosey like many others.
1	I have a fear of needles and am getting a shot today, but now I feel better
1/1	I have a fear of needles and am getting a shot today, but now I feel better :)
0/0/0/0	I have a friend who chooses not to vaccinate her children. They travel around the world, and guess what? They are doing fine! They never get any of these diseases. If i have the opportunity to do it all over again i will never would vaccinated my kids.
0/0	I have a friend who is 56 years old. She has four kids. Youngest is a college sophomore. She didn’t give any vaccines to her kids. They attended public schools. All four are healthy.
1/0	I have a friend who refuses to get vaccinated because her friend is a healthcare worker and she told my friend that the vaccine contains eggs which my friend is allergic to. That’s entirely not true but she still refuses to and she has asthma.
1/0	I have a friend who was on a ventilator for weeks. That’s all I needed to see before getting my shot. 💉
1	I have a friend who who's been in martial arts since he was 11, eats super healthy and still got COVID and reinfected with Delta. He's now got ongoing respiratory issues so this wellness mindset doesn't equal no risk to one's health.
0/0	I have a higher chance of getting struck by lighting than dying from Covid, no thanks 😂
0/0	I have a right to decide what goes into my body.
1/1	I have actually managed to avoid COVID thus far, and I do chalk that up to me getting the vaccine and being generally careful.
1/1	I have already started my 1 year old’s vaccine series but she just had the virus this past weekend & I CANNOT understand why anyone wouldn’t vaccinate
1/1	I have always been pro vaccine and have been informing, educating and helped people around me. One of the biggest obstacles have been false information and lack of easy to understand graphics.
0/0	I have always been skeptical. Now I know they are bad!
0/0	I have an Immune system like King Kongs Cousin , I don't want to mess that up...
0/1	I have an Immune system like King Kongs Cousin , I don't want to mess that up…
1/1/1	I have an almost identical story when it comes to COVID too, the vaccines are so, so worth getting!
1/1	I have an autoimmune condition that I have to get infusions to suppress my immune system for. I caught covid three days after said infusion to kill my b-cells and I had a fever for 14 days, terrible body aches, blacked out in the shower, and was not eating. Sometimes I think the people blessed with great health assume that's the case for everyone, it's not. You have people with cancer, immunosuppressed, diabetes, obesity, etc. I got two doses of the vaccine prior and I do wonder if this virus would have put me in the hospital if I didn't.
0/0	I have an autoimmune disorder (Hashimotos), never had a vaccine, never wore a mask, and never got covid.
1/1	I have an autoimmune disorder, and I'm not taking a chance considering how caliver or downright wrong people are about Covid. The numbers have dropped for a range of reasons including many people are stupid and don't care about the people around them. I'm doing what I can to make sure that I don't get it...again.
1/1	I have autism and I find it so funny when people say vaccines cause autism
1/1	I have autism, and tbh it's not the end of the world really :) I'm pretty darn good with Rubik's cubes & puzzles, and a bit shy/antisocial, but I don't care. I'm happy how I am thanks :) what I would find the end of my world though is getting measles, mumps, rubella, polio..... anything like that, and losing the ability to do stuff I love, or you know, casually die or whatever... I think I prefer being autistic to dead.
0/0	I have been around Drs MD variety enough to know that they are trained to give non-answers to your questions and lie lie lie and lie some more for their own benefit and agenda. The great Ronald Reagan the Republican Grand Master Worshipful Leader had the foresight to give the vaccine manufacturers a “no accountability clause” because they knew how ineffective vaccines against viruses are.
0/-1	I have been curious about this, I have a friend that is dealing with extreme paranoia,this is still going on after two years. She’s had two jabs.
0/1	I have been experiencing tingling, numbness and muscle spasms in my feet since receiving the vaccine. I had Pfizer.
0/0	I have been in perfect health all my life. But after I got the vaccine. My health has been steadily in decline.
1/1/1/1	I have been vaccinated and boosted. I haven’t had Covid-19. Seems like it works sometimes.
1/1	I have been waiting for a video like this thanks it really shows that even though there are risk (very very very small ones) it is way safer than the sickness its self so great job!
0/0	I have been waiting for years now for normies to wake and realize just what their government has done to them. And to their children. The depth and breadth of criminality here is unprecedented.
1	I have cancer. I'm getting the Covid and flu vaccines and anything else they'll give me.

1/1	I have covid it’s been rough but I will live through it because of the vaccination
1/1	I have covid right now! Thought I just had a cold but tested anyway. POSITIVE. I'm 74 years old and SO glad I've had all my vaccines!
1/1	I have endometriosis and Thyroid cancer. Got vaccinated I feel great my life hasn't changed. Honestly I had nausea for a few days and that's it. A friend of mine just lost her dad who was not vaccinated, my mom who is the healthiest person I know got it and is still struggling with her breathing 1 year later. I got covid before getting vaccinated a year ago and still haven't completely recovered from taste and smell. Honestly I wouldn't hesitate to get vaccinated.
1/1	I have every single vaccine that's ever come out and I'm fine.
1/-1	I have family that passed away from Covid pre-vaccine rollout. I also have family that won’t get vaccinated (not due to political beliefs, but due to mistrust of pharmaceuticals). I’m in a bad spot as I am vaxxed and wish everyone would be. I wouldn’t mock the death of public officials who speak out against the vaccine. I just wish they weren’t so stubborn
1/1	I have felt fine after all my Covid vaccinations, glad to have protection from this virus.
0/0	I have friends who regret taking the vaccine, and that makes me think twice. 🤨
1/1	I have full faith in the vaccine’s ability to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
1/1	I have got every shot/booster. So grateful!
0/0	I have got many sorts of weird health issues post vaccine. At the age of only 32. Frequent migraines, frequent inflammations throughout the body, nerve pain, fatigue etc. It feels like im about to rot and die.
1/1	I have got my first dose of Covishield vaccine....Need to wait for 45 days for second dose and hoping to defeat this covid
0/0	I have had Pfizer 2 times an will have no more now , it started 2 weeks after now I can hold anything for longer than 15 minutes as I get painful numbness an tingling in the bottom 3 fingers on both hands an is getting worse
0/1	I have had a heart attack and 2 other heart issues since having the Pfizer vaccine. I actually worked for Pfizer at the time
1/1	I have had a lot of vaccines in my life, and it hasn’t affected me negatively.
1/1	I have had all the vaccines and no problems whatsoever. I had one mild case of COVID but no long-term effects from it. The vaccine is safer than getting COVID which can cause long-lasting problems
1/1/1/1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1/1	I have had every Covid shot and boosters and no regrets at all.
0/0	I have had every booster and get covid all the time.
1/1	I have had four different brands of corona vaccine. just gave me sore arm for a few minutes.
1/1	I have had four different brands of rona vaccine. Novavax just gave me sore arm for a few minutes.
1/1	I have had many here (I'm immune suppressed) and feel just fine. Didn't even get a sore arm from my flu and COVID shots this year at the same time and arm.
1/1	I have had multiple C19 jabs and never had any issues, everyone I know is in the same boat. No issues. It’s less than 1% who have issues. Facts
1/1	I have had multiple C19 jabs and never had any issues, everyone I know is in the same boat. No issues. It’s less than 1% who have issues. Facts.
1/1	I have had my first and am eagerly awaiting my second. Then I can hug my grandmother who has also had both of hers
0/0	I have had no shots and dont plan on gettig one ever.
0/0	I have had ongoing health issues since I was vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine which was forced by my government employer. I wish I never had the vaccine. Ruined my health and life.
0/0	I have had the polio vaccine, measles, mumps, rubella, got a nice big scar from smallpox vaccine. Only difference is that I never got any of those diseases!!! People still getting COVID after inoculation!!!
0/0	I have had the virus twice. each time lasted 3 days, I'm unvacced and 72 years old.
0/0/0/0/1	I have had to get a lot of these shots now because of my immunodeficiency. I have made a routine around it now. I take Tylenol or Advil an hour before the shot. Also an antihistamine like Zyrtec or Benadryl. My immunologist said Zyrtec is better since it lasts 24 hours, and most of the side effects will happen within the first 72 hours. I found drinking electrolyte drinks helps, and I try to get my shot in the afternoon and then eat a large dinner. For some reason having a large meal afterwards seems to help. I take it easy that evening and get to bed early, then I can go to work the next day with some Tylenol. I had Novavax last fall and it was a cake walk compared to the mRNA. I still got Moderna this spring, because that's what was available. I hope I can get Novavax again this fall, but the general consensus is to get the vaccine that you have available in your area.
1/1	I have had zero side effects from the Covid vaccine and boosters… Despite anti vax lot saying they’d be millions dead by now… Seems they were wrong! Who else had no effects at all????
0/0/0/0/0	I have half a brain cell and love my family so none of us took any of it. We will never forget or forgive those who treated us as convicts..
1/1	I have heard tons of positive from the ppl that were in the trial! All of them did well. Most of them have their stories up on here or TikTok.
1/1	I have injected thousands with the Pfizer vaccine. Never saw a reaction. The older crowd 80 years on up to 104 was excited to receive a dose.
1/1	I have it and am still here. How about that.
1/0	I have just had a serious bout of FLU ( Influenza) Not the first time in my life........... I'm fine now. I medicated myself - also took Vit C on a two hourly basis. So....... with this new virus - Novo Virus or Metapneumovirus
0/0	I have known people who had completed their vaccines who still got a very serious case of covid or have died of heart attack. Isn't it crazy how they push people to get it with just barely 2 years of study when they even don't have SARS or Mers covid vaccines before?!
1/1	I have less than zero sympathy for anti vaxxers and I believe the world is a better place without their stupidity.
0/0	I have lost 22 people in my life to date I’m sorry but these shots are just not safe
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I have lost 22 people in my life to date I’m sorry but these shots are just not safe.
0/0	I have lost all faith in the vaccine programme and am offended at the untruths told and how this is all continuing to be managed.
0/0	I have lost just about all trust in the medical community after they became medical tyrants and shills for big pharma. I told my PCP as much. He was not happy.
0/0	I have medical reasons not to take it. Stop forcing people.
0/0	I have more faith in vitamins and a healthy lifestyle than needles.
1/1	I have more respect for flat earthers than anti-vaxxers. At least they’re not contagious.
0/0	I have my own immune system thanks. No soy boy androids guna persuade me to take their shit.
1/1	I have my three doses and I can honestly say that it has helped prevent me from getting sick. I used to get sick often but after getting vaccinated I’ve gone from getting sick four times a year to only once.
0/0	I have natural immunity from a previous infection.
0/0	I have never felt as lied to at this level ever as I did just now, seriously, the level of creepiness of this is UN-President'ed.
0/0	I have never gotten a covid vaccination. I don’t plan to, honestly.
1/1	I have never had COVID either. All of the vaccines and boosters plus RSV and annual Flu.
0/0	I have never had covid, never wore a mask, never took a test , no flu shot and no covid shot, same for my husband and kid. We are all alive and well.
0/-1	I have never received any vaccinations in my entire life.
0/0	I have never received any vaccinations in my entire life. When a sibling was sick, my father, a physician, used to put all the kids together. A route to build immunity naturally. I recall the difficulty of dealing with a high fever when I occasionally got sick, but he never gave us aspirin or acetaminophen because "fever is a natural process that the body uses to get rid of the infection." Furthermore, I have never in my adult life taken any medication—not even an antibiotic. Perhaps, we have to objectively rethink the whole modern medical approach.
1/1	I have never regretted any vaccine I or my children and grandchildren have received. We are alive and well because of them. They work
0/0	I have never seen a product in history where questioning it gets you banned from social media
1/1	I have no covid but i will take the vaccine
0/0	I have no desire to take the vaccine either however, I truly believe that you will not be allowed to do certain things like fly on plane
0/0	I have no words for you scummy vaccine manufacturers
0/0	I have not got the vax and everyone who is vaxed are falling around me like flies

0/0	I have not, will not, nor will I ever get a COVID-19 shot. Emphasis on the shot bc by definition it’s not a vaccine.
1/0	I have nothing against people not having the vaccine, just don't turn up at Hospital wanting help.
1/1	I have polio. I'm 25 and I was born in China where I did not receive the vaccine. It's a rough life and I wouldn't wish it on anyone else
1/1	I have received dose 1 as I belong to the risk group. I will receive dose 2 in a little over a month. A matter of course. A fantastic campaign and of course I am rolling up.
1/1	I have seen in my patients. Some of them seems to progress faster. So vaccination is better way to cure.
1/1	I have several students who got vaccinated and a few with their second shot. No issues. Doing well and they feel safer.
0/0	I have sickle cell anemia. I'm not taking the vaccine until they do study on people like me. I'm on vitamin D3 and liquid vitamin A - zink. My diet is all organic I don't eat fast food, I cook my meals.
1/1	I have so far. Similarly to how people get a flu jab every year, like it was intended to he given out anyway
0/0	I have so many friends that are unvaccinated , caught Covid and were fine . Also friends triple jabbed and got really sick from Covid
1/1/1	I have stage 4 lung cancer, received my first round of covid-19 vaccine in December. No side effects other than some soreness in the muscle for a few days. I'll be receiving my second dose on the 26th. Just wanted to say thanks for all the informed info!
1/1	I have taken all recommended vaccine doses, I have not gotten Covid-19 and I have not had any side effects
1/1	I have taken every vaccine and shot for everything. If I had Covid, I didn’t notice it.
1/1	I have taken my first and second shot and have only felt a little sore in my arm
0/0	I have the exact same symptoms. Only one Pfizer shot. My life is basically over. I have. Lived in terror since 2021. I don’t get better. I get sick every time I leave the house.
1/1	I have to send my son to school. He has severe asthma, and wears a mask. He's vaccinated, but vaccination rates in my state are low (NH). Most of the teachers, and students don't wear masks.
1/1	I have told a few people “if you think there is something better to bring to the table then bring it” and we know there isn’t. It’s not a perfect science but nothing is. Im grateful for it too. I’m immune compromised so I need it. People arguing is just a control thing
1/1	I have two children (2 years and 7 months old) both are fully vaccinated with both shots (along with boosters for the oldest) against covid.
0/0	I have vaccine injuries, muscular twitching since the day of the vaccine going on a few months now
0/0	I have very little trust in any further vaccine for Covid.
1/0	I have worked for 8 years in Upstate New York hospitals from 2015-2023. And I did not see one single patient in the ICU, ER or med surg who died as a direct result of SARS 2 covid.
0/-1	I have worked for 8 years in Upstate New York hospitals from 2015-2023. And I did not see one single patient in the ICU, ER or med surg who died as a direct result of SARS 2 covid. They died from medical mal-practice and from a denial of early and alternative treatments and being forced onto ventilators.
0/0/0/0/0	I have zero medical training but it beggars belief that medical experts didn’t do what i did and that is research into mRNA technology and realize its well documented dangers and trial failures
1/1	I haven't been able to smell or taste for 6 months now, get vaccinated, you don't want to have to deal with this.
0/0	I haven't been the same since my vaccines. No energy, constant feeling of unwellness. Depression, anxiety, lethargy, aching and just a feeling of utter dispondancy.
0/0	I haven't gotten the flu shot, I don't get the flu. I'm not getting this either. "But it's free." Nothing is free, everything has a price.
0/0	I haven't had a flu vaccine for 25 years and haven't had the flu for 25 years.
1	I haven't had a flu vaccine since I was 13 I get the flu EVERY year.
0/0/0/0/0/0	I haven't had a jab in my life, I'm seventy-three and haven't even had a cold in over forty-five years.
0/0	I haven't had any covid shots or had covid and I'm still here!
0/0	I haven't had any covid vaccine but I know tens of people that have taken and are suffering long term side effects.
0/0	I haven't heard of any politicians complaining about side effects. Why?
0/0	I havent been the same since the vaccine either. On April 13th 2022 I got my second Pfizer Covid shot besides a metallic taste in my mouth I felt ok for a few hours. However Something went wrong. 7 hours after at around 10 at night as I was getting ready for bed I suddenly felt short on air and begin Wheezing quite hard actually weeks later I saw my doctor and she confirmed something I didnt expect. My asthma that was well controlled happened again and this time its NOT under control it is 2025 and Im still wheezing and need my inhaler more than I did before. Some days il be ok the next day Il need 1 or even 2 treatments oh and if you think that was all I had nope. In 2024 in June I found out I had a silent Heart Attack and abnormal heart beat. So add that to the list. Safe to say I wont be getting any booster
0/0	I haven’t got a single vaccine and never got “covid”.
0/0	I haven’t had a single shot either.
0/0	I haven’t had it, and am still here. That’s the real data people should focus on.
1/1	I hear the vaccines are real effective.
0/0	I hear we don't want to go back where we were? Well I have seen no hospitals over flowing. Ever. And they said our hospitals could not handle it. Well they did. Where I am at no work closed. No mask. And also before you paid people to stay at home. Lastly the insurance companies will love testing every week. Follow the money. Always.
0/0	I heard Joe threatening to get the jab ! And Justin Trudesu did the same and I didn't trust eather therefore I said NO
0/0	I heard about people getting blood clots from this vaccine.
0/0	I heard it has serious side effects!
1/1	I heard some people organized an anti-vaccine party, and they all ended up dying. Hahaha.
0/0	I heard that fauci knew about covid in 2019 and that it was all a lie.... I had gotten covid in 2021 it was almost like getting the flu ever since then I have never gotten it again....
0/0	I heard that people got seriously ill or even died after vaccination, but those stories were covered up.
0/0/0	I heard that the vaccine may have long-term side effects, so let's wait and see.
1/1	I honestly don’t understand how you could be anti-vaxx if your child is allergic to the vaccine - you’re the one that needs those vaccines and that herd immunity the most ??
0/0	I honestly doubt if the vaccine agencies had enough time to test this vaccine in a loong run. The long time side affects is scary!!!
1/1/1	I honestly had no idea there were so many anti-vaxers in the world! In the US it seems to be very much intertwined with politics. When Trump was president, all the republicans were touting “Operation Light Speed” but as soon as he lost the election, they seriously all became anti-vaxers over night! So enraging… they’re willing to let the pandemic drag on just to make the Biden administration look bad, I guess
1/1/1	I honestly think that we need to vaccinate ASAP in order to prevent the further spread of COVID. 1% of the world has been infected with COVID at some point and if we don't do this quickly that could increase. Sometimes it's better to sacrifice personal gain for the well-being of the community. Even if this vaccine is dangerous scientists and institutions would notice and shut it down quickly. Besides these vaccines are made by trusted professionals.
0/0	I hope everyone that does get a vaccine ends up being well, but I can't say I'm comfortable getting a medicine that doesn't have 5-10 years of rigorous real world testing to various, unforeseen consequences and interactions. It seems like an overreaction to get humans en mass to test these new medicines. We have animal trials for a reason. I hope that all the variants people are rushing to get on your advice end up being safe and effective as advertised and I end up being overly cautious and needlessly skeptical.
0/0	I hope from the bottom of my heart that you will experience the "benefits" of vaccination !!!
0/1	I hope it works for everyone who takes the chance but I will never take it, there is no proof that u will not get the virus and what the side effects will be, relying on my immune system
1/1	I hope our government in the UK is producing such effective vacinnaiton messages
1/1	I hope so, I work in Environmental Health in a major hospital. Was just informed that we can make an appointment. Guess I will get it, it's the 2 dose one.
1	I hope that we get a vaccine soon.
0/0/1/0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
1/1	I hope the vaccine works; I wanna go back to school in-person
1/1	I hope the vaccines are ready for the world
1/1	I hope the vaccines will save all the people around the world. God bless you all out there
1/1	I hope there's a vaccine by 2021. I miss the old normal.
1	I hope these “my body my choice” individuals maintain the same energy when talking about abortions and the bodily autonomy rights of pregnant people.
1/1	I hope this by vaccine works for everybody .
1/1	I hope this vaccine can get to as many people as possible as soon as possible.
1/1	I hope this vaccine works by 2021 the vaccine will spread all over the world.
1/1	I hope this works! Thank you to all first responders and people who are trying to make this vaccine!
1/-1	I hope we someday honor those who died for these people's freedom, and I mean the people who die of anything that they can't get adequate treatment for because a non-vaccinated Covid patient takes up bed space and resources. People like my Dad.
0/0	I hope you can find someone who is prepared to discuss the risks with you. Most people have been ridiculed and shutdown for questioning the safety and efficacy of this mRNA vaccine. Science used to encourage rigorous debate and questions. I wish you well with your work
1/0	I hope you got safe and effective ASTRAZENICA vaccine which just got banned in Australia. Millions of people got this vaccine
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I hope you've opened your eyes to what they have actually done to us with the vaccine.
0/0	I hope your friend is better. We had a family friend who died shortly after the jab. She told her doc she wasn't feeling good and died before she was able to be seen- not knowing what was going on. Turned out her oxygen plummeted. I don't see that as a coincidence no matter what the masses want to believe. We have two other friends who haven't been right since and I pray it doesn't lead into anything else.
1/1/1	I hope,there will be a vaccine.,i really want to lived like normal
0/0	I hoped to find informations about long term drawbacks of the mrna vaccines like decremential effects on our bodies natural immune reaction to future pathogens.
1/1	I hoping that Philippines can also receive this vaccine..
0/0	I hugged a vaccinated and she made me bleed for days. I was around a vaccinated person and he gave me migraine with nausea.
0/-1	I intend to wait for further efficacy and safety trials on the COVID-19 vaccine
1/1	I jiust got my booster after double jab of phizer in april..I feel great! I have been maskless since april went to yankee stadium 3 times with 30,000 thousand people and casinos and supermarkets.and no problems!!! t

1/1	I just came out of the hospital with post Covid pneumonia and I’ve been boosted. Get them.
1/1	I just don’t understand how people can be okay with spreading misinformation about vaccines.
0/0	I just don’t want it because I don’t want it. Do I really need a reason other than that?
1/1	I just got COVID, flu, and RSV vaccines all at once. I did so a few hours ago. Now I am kind of light-headed, and I have a bit of a headache. I'm older.after couples of days i felt better #Noneedtofear !!
1/1	I just got both yesterday. So tried today. Had the chills, fever, muscle ache, dizziness, etc…I’m still very fatigued. I am so glad I have the next couple of days off so I can feel better. I know I’m not sick, but to experience the symptoms, man, not fun either. But I’m like this with every vaccine.
1/1	I just got it with my flu shot, and will likely do it every year.
1	I just got mine at my pharmacy for my Covid and flu shots. My mom is a boomer and she got hers last week. I did get Covid after a cruise (duh) last year. There was a rough couple of days but, overall it wasn’t bad. I have risk issues so, I feel like the shot might have kept it from getting worse.
1/1	I just got my 1st Dose today! Here we go!!
0/0	I just got my first Pfizer shot 5 days ago, and I have intense vertigo and dizziness. Apparently, 16.5% of people experience this, and some report this symptom lasting up to a month... Nothing about these vaccines is "safe". It's just a panic option with an "acceptable" percentage of people who will have terrible reactions. I'm one of them. Fuck these vaccines. No amount of money in the world could make me go in for my second shot!
1/1	I just got my first Pfizer shot and as I'm sitting here with a slightly sore arm (utterly normal) I am enjoying understanding what is happening in my body as I type this comment.

0/0	I just got my first dose pfizer vaccine today and I have an allergy reaction after I got the injection
0/-1	I just got my first shot 4 weeks ago. On the first day after the shot, I felt itchy on my palm and then on the 4th day, many small rash appear on my neck, back and hand and now it all over my body. It’s been about 4weeks already and it’s not getting anywhere. What should I do? Should I get the second dose?
1/-1	I just got my first shot and I feel fine 8 hours later
1/1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science
1/1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!👍
1/1/1/1	I just got my flu and Covid at CVS. I attended a large event and did not want to take any chances. My family has received all the Covid boosters along the way and have not been ill.
1/1	I just got my latest vaccine about a month ago. Then my first Shingles vaccine. Then a mild case of Shingles. (Which is not fun but would have been so much worse without the vaccine I'm sure) Next is the flu shot.
0/1	I just got my vaccine yesterday, and I feel the pain in the injected area,fever,body pain I just take my paracetamol every 4hrs I hope I get well soon.

1/1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom. I feel perfectly fine otherwise!
1/-1	I just got vaccinated by a 5th not very common vaccine, I was hoping someone could help me out.
1/1	I just got vaccinated with moderna (mRNA) yesterday. So far so good I have no side effects
0/0	I just got vaccinated yesterday and my left arm hurt so bad I can't even lift it up
1/1	I just got vaccinated yesterday.
1/1	I just had Covid in September and they don’t recommend getting a booster within 3 months of having it. Otherwise, I would have!
1/1	I just had my booster, chose Moderna. Thought I'd mix it up after having Pfizer for the first 2. Feeling fine...Go science
1/1	I just hope I can actually have the vaccine. Some I can't take such as the nasal flu vaccine.
0/0	I just know lots of people that regret taking but 0 people that regret not having it.
0/0	I just lost my 32 year old cousin to a heart attack and I can’t help but wonder if the jab has something to do with it, 32 is so young…I hardly ever heard of young people having heart attacks before the COVID jab stuff
1/1	I just lost my sister to Covid 2 weeks ago and she absolutely refused to get vaccinated or wear masks. Who knows who she got it from or who she spread it to. As soon as i could get the vaccine I got it. And I am glad I got it.
1/1	I just lost my sister to Covid 2 weeks ago and she absolutely refused to get vaccinated or wear masks. Who knows who she got it from or who she spread it to. As soon as i could get the vaccine I got it. And I am glad I got it. On my sisters death bed she still believed the vaccine was bad for her.
0/0	I just read that 1223 deaths were caused by the Pfizer vaccine within the first three months.
1/1	I just received the Moderna vaccine yesterday. No side effects except for a slight soreness at the injection site. I wish everybody can watch this video and hopefully everyone can get the vaccine when it’s available for them. We can get rid of this virus together.
0/0	I just retired because I am not going to take the vaccin.
1/0	I just returned from a nice holiday with friends and family out of town, where my partner and I were the only unjabbed out of the group of about 20 people or so. All of of the fully-jabbed and boosted adults reported contracting covid multiple times over the past year. My partner and I were the only ones present that have had no sickness since this all began, other than a slight cold bug that lasted all of 5 days about a year back. Several of the (relatively young) adults that were present recently had heart attacks, one requiring a triple bypass surgery and his spouse required open heart surgery... both now require a slew of prescription drugs including statins. Several of the adults present also displayed profound cognitive decline/forgetfulness that was not present when we last saw them 13 months ago. I had a brutal migraine headache behind my right eye ball, along with really bad fatigue the entire time we were there.
1/1	I just took both of mine and I did run fever, body aches and pain. It’s my 3rd day and I feel rundown. I just take Tylenol and ibuprofen for pain
1/1	I just took my whole family to get vaccinated.
1/1	I just want life back to normal. If a vaccine helps, I’ll take it.
1/-1	I just want this debate to end. The division is exhausting. 😩
1/1	I just want to say thank you to any scientists who may possibly read this. Your research, as I am sure you know, is invaluable.
1/1	I just wished those unvaccinated cared. We could end all of this if everyone cared for their country and helped not only themselves but their fellow citizens of the United States of America.
0/0	I just wonder, if the vaccine works, why do vaccinated people still get sick?"
0/0	I keep hearing about people having sudden health issues after taking the shot. It’s scary how no one is allowed to question it.
0/0	I keep hearing people saying they regret taking it but haven't heard a single person say they wish they had. I am a happy antivaxxer and won't change my decision
0/0/0/0	I keep hearing people saying they regret taking it but haven't heard a single person say they wish they had. I am a happy pureblood
1/1	I keep seeing gloating about how all the vaxxed are either going to die or have something horrible medically happen to us in the middle of September. And on and on it goes.
1/1	I keep seeing really stupid memes on my feeds saying "if it doesn't prevent Covid-19, why are we getting vaccinated". This is why. It prevents death, it works.
0/0	I kept following the science but it led me to money and control
1/1	I kind of figured the 12 Billions of doses of vaccine used and only hundreds of complications of note... proved it was one of the most safe vaccine rolls outs ever
1/1	I kind of think of it from the scientist's PoV: the vaccine is meant to save people from the virus. You're not really saving people if the solution itself is dangerous. So while they're definitely putting the petal to the metal with things like skipping non-human trials, they're pretty heavily incentivized, just by their job, to ensure it's safe at the end of the process. (It does, however, mean the human trials become a little more risky for those involved. When things are rushed, there is more risk. It's just that there's also a choice of where that risk goes. In this case, it's largely collected in the financial side and in human trial stages.)
0/0	I knew ahead of time what poison was in the jab...never gettin near me
0/0	I knew it. Big pharma shills
1/-1	I knew nothing about the vaccine until now...this actually cleared up a lot of doubts!
1/1	I knew someone back when I was like 6 that was unvaccinated. He knew that vaccines were safe and complained that his parents didn't vaccinate him but they wouldn't let him get vaccinated. It's odd to think that he was actually smarter than them.
1/1	I knew that it wasn’t to hurt me, but to protect me and others who can’t get vaccinated.
1/1	I knew the vaccine was a no-brainer.

0/0	I know many who have gotten sick not long after receiving the covid vaccine yeah the COVID vaccine is effective at getting you sick that explains why so many still havent gotten there vaccine
1/1	I know more people harmed by COVID than by vaccines.

0/0	I know people who got vaccinated and still ended up in the hospital. What’s the point?
0/0	I know people who got vaccinated and still got really sick.
1/1	I know people who went to the hospital from covid and 1 that died from covid but I don’t know one person who went to the hospital or died from the vaccine. The risk reward is plain as day to me.
1/1	I know people worry about side effects, but compared to the effects of COVID, the choice seemed clear to me. 💉
0/0	I know so many people who have told me they ended up with pneumonia after vaccination. I know people who have family members who have died of COVID, but I know people who actually caught COVID after getting the vaccine. And in both cases it was pretty bad pneumonia, saturation of 50-60% on room air.
0/0	I know someone personally that just had a horrible neurological reaction to the booster. She got the booster voluntarily and has been suffering ever since smh!
0/-1	I know someone who died after getting astrazeneca (blood clot)

0/0	I know someone who got a blood clot after the vaccine. That’s enough for me to say no. 🚫
0/0	I know someone who got myocarditis after the vaccine. That’s not a risk I’m willing to take. 💔
1/0	I know someone who got the vaccine and then had a stroke shortly after. It's made me really wary.
0/0	I know someone who had NO Medical issues but was a smoker. The person quit smoking for over a year before covid, then excepted the vaccine. Once he did so he couldn't stop getting sick and coughing and the doctor stated that they now had bronchitis. I believe that it's engineered to look for a weakness then exasperate you on said weakness. Same as someone i saw that had allergies for a season now it's all year, same as someone i saw that had something dormant and now it's to the point the person is having bad reactions.

0/0	I know someone who was perfectly healthy before the shot but got sick right after.
0/0	I know someone who’s friend got the shot. The guy was healthy for someone in his fifties, didn’t have any health issues, yet died ten days after getting the shot.
0/0	I know that I will NEVER take another vaccine for a “Pandemic”. Done with the WHO and CDC.
0/-1	I know the leftwing media says he's an anti-vaxer. But I don't know if that's completely true or not. I think the right stance is that vaccines generally speaking are life-saving and borderline miraculous. But the COVID vaccine was ineffective and poorly created.
1/1	I know the vaccine wasn’t meant to stop the spread, but to make it affect the person less if they were to get it
1/1	I know they are working as hard as they can but I think they need to speed up a bit more because when winter comes all country's might have another spike in cases so the vaccines need to hurry up before any more people die

1/0	I learned from RFK that a lot of people who take vaccines actually become artistic!
0/0	I legit got the virus and only had a annoying cough for a few days and it all went away lol, no vaccine nothing
1/1	I like how people freak out about "chemicals." "Oh, I don't eat those. They're full of chemicals." Water is a "chemical." What if I call it "di-hydrogen oxide"? Would you refuse to drink it?
0/0	I like how they ignore literally allllllll of the other evidence in young people. And only relate it to the latest booster. This is strictly damage control
1/1/1	I like the sound of what I’m hearing! This vaccine is our best chance in stopping COVID-19!
1/1	I like this article, thank you! My wife got the Moderna and I got the J&J. We are doing great. I honestly don't care which one of them is the "best", anything is better than nothing,
0/0	I like you was lied to with claims of achieving "herd immunity". Everyone that I know that got the vaccines has had covid multiple times. I suffered horrible side effects from 2 x Pfizer shots in 2021 with ongoing symptoms today. Heart, neurological, hives just to name a few. My biggest regret ever.
0/0/0	I literally don’t know anyone who has the virus. And most everyone I know is unvaccinated.
1/1/0	I literally got vaccinated 6 times on one day, i i guess my inmune system is going to have a party
1/1	I literally have yet to find someone that can give me a goof reason why not to get it
1/1	I live in France and literally booked an appt for a relative yesterday for TODAY. Rural areas have availability but some just want to stay in their area.
1/1	I live in Israel and since almost everyone is vaccinated we feel like we have our lives back..Almost everything is like before
1/1	I live in Kenya where there is no question to not getting vaccinations.
0/-1	I live in NY, I am an essential worker who has been working the whole pandemic and I know 0 people who have died from covid....And I'm sure that makes me a racist or fascist or climate denier or bigot or something. w/e. I see with my eyes, I don't perceive with my mind.
1	I live in South East Asia. I see a lot of Americans don’t want the COVID 19 vaccine. Could they band together and donate their vaccine doses to people in South East Asia like Indonesia, the Philippines etc who desperately want it?
1/1	I live in the south where unfortunately a lot of people are anti vaccine Trump supporters. I did my part and got the Moderna vaccine and all I got for side effects is a sore arm just like you get from any other shot.
0/0	I look back now and highly regret the 3 shots I got, especially in light of what we are learning now.
1/1	I lost a friend to Covid. I teach college and it's still going around. Really amping up right now. I get the vaccine. All of them.
1/-1	I lost my dad to Covid and I had Covid at the same time. I found that many people actually hated me for it. Why was that? Because the deaths are supposed to only be on TV. Casualties are hated when they give of their accounts. The state sent me a letter asking if I would donate convalescent plasma. After I returned to work and when I seen how the public was treating this pandemic. I said they’re not getting one ounce. After all it didn’t work for my dad. He died of Covid. We didn’t have a choice. There was no vaccine at the time. We were among the first cases here in town.
1	I lost my dad to Covid and I’m just 18. I told him many times to get the vaccine, but he was skewed by political views. It hurts a lot to see him gone. Im sorry if you rely on your news station to tell you what’s best for you. It is your decision. Don’t come to a decision and never look back. Stay open minded. Think about those around you. Life is precious
0/0	I lost my job because I refused the shotâ€”unbelievable.
0/1	I lost my job due to the Covid madness and needed to dip into my super ( twice ) to survive. This needs to be given back to us single women over 40!
1/1	I lost my mom to long covid. I saw her slowly deteriorate and be on oxygen and then pass away. So yeah, taking the vaccine was the best decision ever.
1/1	I lost my mom to long covid. I saw her slowly deteriorate and be on oxygen and then pass away. So yeah, taking the vaccine was the best decision ever. Later when my dad got covid (post vaccine), he didn’t have any major issues despite being a cancer survivor.
0/0	I love being a conspiracy theorist. Maligned, slandered, hated....but still right
1/1	I love how its so easy to find an antivax comment to post on r/vaxxhappened
0/-1	I love how one of the “journalists” shouted as he was walking away, “is this constitutional MR. President?”
0/0	I love how the same people that would normally rail against the pharmaceutical industry as being nothing but a bunch of evil and greedy companies are now willing to blindly accept that the vaccines they're producing are safe and effective even going so far as to shame others that are skeptical. Vaccines are normally tested developed and tested over the course of almost a decade and the pharmaceutical companies that produce them are usually completely liable for any harmful effects of their vaccine down the road. Therefore it is in their best interests to produce as safe of a vaccine as possible. Conversely the COVID vaccines have been developed and tested over the course of less than a year. On top of that at least in the US the government is providing any and all companies producing a vaccine blanket immunity from any sort of liability that the vaccines incur. This encourages blatant corner cutting as all of the pharmaceutical companies now have an incentive to be first to market without having to worry about how well their vaccines actually perform. Most medicines in general rarely make it past all three phases of clinical trials so don't be fooled into believing that the vaccines being rushed out the door would be any different if they had actually be thoroughly tested. COVID has about a 99% recovery rate and yes while it can leave you with long term health effects it's not common. A rushed vaccine that by the way is predicted to only be about 90-95% efficient that could potentially leave you with god-knows-what long term side effects in 5 to 10 years is not the something we should be injecting everyone on Earth with until further testing is done. I'm not saying that COVID should be taken lightly but remember that we have immune systems for a reason andI urge everyone to think twice about getting the vaccine. If you're still interested in getting it more power to you but just be prepared for the future consequences. It could be perfectly safe for all we know. But that's the thing; we don't know. Until the benefits outweigh the costs I and many others like me will not be getting the vaccine.

0/0	I love trump but there is zero chance I’m getting that vaccine lol
1/1	I love vaccines and the things they have done for humanity. My only concern is the synthetic lipid layer that holds the RNA in this new type of vaccine, which if I'm correct never existed in other vaccines? If you have any info on it, please reply below, it would make me less worried to know more.
1	I love watching anti-vaxxers talk about ‘freedom’ until COVID takes their ability to breathe.
1/1	I love when people say they will wait for more research as if they ever even opened a medical study of any kind
1/1	I m a kidney transplanted. TY for getting vaccinated and avoiding putting my life at risk <3
0/1	I m a nurse and had 5 coworkers all female all in their 20s get myocard or pericard so it's not just young men. I could go on about what I saw during my time at the hospital but I usually get those comments taken down

0/0/0/0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.

1/1	I make sure that I stay up to date with my vaccinations. My health depends on it!
0/1	I man I know ate a Greggs Sausage roll, and the next day his uncle was hit by a car.....OPEN YOUR EYES SHEEPLE! :p :p :p
0/0	I mean if you get Covid twice before and after vaccination, then this vaccine is probably useless
1/0	I mean so was the vaccine but we don't talk about that now do we.......pharmaceutical industry started off as chemical companies always remember that
1/1	I mean with scientists from every corner of the globe working together and sharing data to accomplish this singular task it would be kind of depressing if it had taken the same amount of time as usual
1/1	I mean yes but it can't fight everything some things are stronger so you need the vaccine so it makes the specialized antibodies that can only kill one virus but do it very well
0/0	I mean.. go ahead and take it if you wanna be runnin around looking like an i am legend zombie
0/0	I met way too many injured persons in my long covid support groups to ever consider getting it. My plan was to get it if things worked out for everyone else but here we are. I figured I could only trust what I saw with my own eyes and I didn't like what I ended up seeing.
1/1	I missed my booster last year and got Covid for the first time. I will definitely be getting it again
1/1	I missed you all SO MUCH! Thanks for being here! Please get vaccinated if you haven't already! 💙 Hope you're staying safe!
0/0	I must OBEY, I must SUBMIT to my powerful overlords. I must be their lab rat and believe in what the powerful overlords call, 'SCIENCE". It would be in my BEST INTREST to give away my freedoms for my powerful overlords protection. I must believe the LIE & I must TRUST the LIE & never question the LIE because the LIE is the TRUTH. If i choose NOT TO OBEY & or SUBMIT i will be made an example of, just to keep the rest of the sheeple in order. So I must OBEY

I chose not to take the jab as I felt it was bad my brother had the jab and died of a heart attack when he was fine before that's why I'm glad I never had the jab and I've been fine
0/0	I never take any vaccines, and I'm totally fine.
0/0	I never took any shots and haven't had covid and I'm 78, my wife had no shots either and got covid once and she's 76. We are very happy with our God given immunity which we decided to rely on after seeing the results of the effects of the MRNA jabs on so many.

0/0	I now have three family members with heart problems who were perfectly healthy before having the jabs, too much coincidence. Evidence out there proves it
0/0	I now live with a life long heart condition from the vaccine. Makes me so angry we were forced to have it
1/1	I once had a nightmare so now I don’t sleep
0/0	I only got the initial shot, but given all that's coming out now I'm glad I didn't get any boosters
1/1	I only have Pfizer because it was the first one available to me I’m just team vaccine. Period.
1/-1	I only trust the J&J/Janssen vaccine (out of the three we get here in the USA). The trials were far more comprehensive and it's a full-fledge viral vector vaccine (tried and tested) unlike mRNA based vaccines. It's also becoming increasingly difficult to find so consider yourself lucky if you are offered the J&J as an option.
0/-1	I opted for the tracking chip dose
0/0	I opted out of taking the jab. I got ridiculed alot but I held my ground. Only 15% of Americans refused the shot
0/1	I participated in the clinical trials! Had some side effects, like fever and chills for the first 24 hours, but was able to just take ibuprofen to help. Definitely worth the results :)
1/1	I personally believe that vaccines are really effective. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, I have been involved in sample collection. However, I received four doses of the vaccine, so I never got infected with COVID-19. Even at the end of 2022, when the restrictions were lifted and everyone around me tested positive, I still didn’t catch it. During that time, I was constantly collecting nucleic acid samples for my colleagues at work. Watching them fall ill, go home to recover, and then return to work was a really unpleasant experience. It wasn't until October 2023 that I finally got infected with COVID-19, and I had to stay at home for almost a month before I fully recovered. That’s why I truly believe in the effectiveness of vaccines. I am convinced that if I had been able to proactively ask for booster shots on time, I could have maintained my immunity against COVID-19.
0/0	I personally know 11 people including family that died from COVID injections.
0/0	I personally know 5 families with teens, 3 teens got fully vaxed & 1 or more boosters, ALL 3 VAXED TEENS ARE SEEING A CARDIOLOGIST & getting sick more often after vaxed than before vaxed & 1 Vaxed teen went to the ER for heart attack symptoms. 2 NON-VAXED teens are healthy.

0/0	I read some reports that the vaccine can't completely prevent infection, and it's useless to take it.
0/0/0	I read someone now has heart inflammation from Pfizer vaccine - that sounds terrible. We take these vaccines and the risk is all on our shoulders esp for those w autoimmune issues it’s a tough place to be.
0/0	I read vaccines can cause infertility.

1/1	I really appreciate all the people who have got there COVID-19 vaccine for those who have not got the shot please do what are you waiting for they are easy to get and we all can beat Covid 19 together
0/0	I really appreciate your try to falsify the claims of this study. Anyway, I would appreciate if you had the same effort to solicit more autopsy studies to clarify those issues. Spike protein Is not supposed to be in plasma, ovaries, brain , myocardium after vaccination( it should only be expressed in the deltoid muscle)I think we need and deserve more transparency from our scientific world. I' m an Italian colleague, a front line neurologist and I' m very concerned about all these medical procedures
1/1	I really don't understand why people don't get vaccinated If you have health issues and can't safely take it, fine, but healthy people? Omg…
1/1	I really don't understand why there's such a fuss about the vaccines, they really are safe and harmless in the vast majority of cases... unlike the virus itself.
0/0	I really hope someone is researching and looking into the Covid vaccines we received to see wtf was added into those shots
1/1	I really hope this vaccine keeps all from catching this terrible virus
1/1	I really hoped my years in retirement would be spent seeing the world in travel. Instead I'm stuck at home because of pandemics and antivaxers, afraid to travel, watching the world fall apart. Thanks Trump!
1/1	I really like the person we see for vaccinations. I was telling her my hesitations over the covid vaccination. She quickly made up my mind when she said that she had never seen a serious reaction in a baby that she vaccinated, but that unvaccinated babies have died from covid. That kind of did it for me. I don't know if there is a real risk from the vaccine, but there is a known and proven risk from not getting it.
0/0	I really regret getting that useless covid vaccine.
0/0	I really regret getting vaccinated. I'll try my best to avoid any more shots in the future.
0/0	I really want to trust you but something tells me not to. Better give those people food if you are so passionate not vaccine!
1/0	I really wouldn't worry about it too much, granted I say that as someone without it
1/1	I received both dosages of the pfizer vaccine and I'm glad I did
1/1	I received first dose of sinovac, it was extremely simplest & painless with no further side effects of any kind... Hope second one will be just like this.
1	I received my 2 vaccines ... I got a bit sore no big deal or horide side effects... For the first few days after... I felt like they shot me up with Speed . Get your vaccination wear your mask ....wash your hand clothes and keep your house and family clean .... and enjoy life .
0/-1	I received my 2024-2025 Moderna shot this morning from CVS ( also got a flu shot too ). Seven hours in and no side effects yet. The way I look at it is if we see another COVID surge in the winter, the CDC/FDA might approve another round of the vaccine. Getting it today puts me at the four month threshold come end of December.
1/1	I received my 3rd shot and a flu shot last week...I will not lie, I had a few days of reactions because of my health, but I want to protect those around me and myself. I feel fine now.
1/1	I received my COVID-19 vaccine and felt a sense of relief and hope. The mild side effects were a small price to pay for protection against the virus.
1/1	I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago. Only side effect was a sore arm at the injection site lasted about 36 hrs. Excited my 2nd dose at the 21 day mark (5/1)!
0/0/1	I received the Novovax vaccine last year and had a few direct exposures and did not contract Covid. Also, my side effects were significantly more tolerable compared to the Moderna shots I had in a prior year.
0/-1	I received the shot and had a debilitating life long effect
0/0	I received the shot once so I didn’t lose my job and I don’t see any reason to get another unless it’s mandatory for employment.
1/1	I received the two dose Moderna in May. I am just now recovering from a rough patch of Covid.
0/-1	I received two COVID vaccines & a booster in December 2021. Caught COVID in September 2021 & now again in late August 2023. Four weeks in, I'm still dealing with fatigue + shaky / weak legs. This bout of COVID has been far worse than when I first caught it in 2021 - and - honestly am not feeling comfortable about getting an additional booster ...
0/0	I received two doses of moderna and since then I can't stop sneezing, especially with the liquid detergent and the fabric softener sheet. I never liked the fish and the smell, but since then it's worse, just the smell of gives me severe nausea, it smells of putrefaction. I am also often tired, empty of energy. Thank you Moderna for scrapping my life.
1/1	I received two vaccines and the booster and it made such a relief from my health anxiety and contracting a severe case of covid. The reason for the boosters is immunity doesn't last all that long. I understand everyone's personal choice but where I live our hospital beds are full and I see you with all non-vaccinated patients. It is tragic anyway you look at it and my best to all of you and stay healthy
1/1	I recently got my second dose of Pfizer. Didn’t hurt as much as the first. I don’t exactly feel completely invincible but damn does it help.
1/-1	I recently had it so I'm waiting for another month or so to get the next shot.
1/1	I recognize that while children are not as affected by COVID as other more risky parts of the population, we also don't know what are the long-term effects of COVID so I'm hoping that by vaccinating my child that it will spare them from the long-term effects.
0/0	I refuse the vaccine

0/0	I refuse!!

0/0/0/0/0	I refused the covid vaccine at age 63. Thanks but no thanks
0/0	I refused the vaccine as a nurse because I already struggled with autoimmune disorders so I was very Leary About the new vaccine. I am thankful I stood my ground.
0/0	I refused the vaccine as a nurse because I already struggled with autoimmune disorders so I was very Leary About the new vaccine. I am thankful I stood my ground. Thank you for sharing this story!
0/0	I refused them all best decision I made!
0/0	I refused to take the shots. I thought the way in which they kept pushing it was highly suspect. I kept getting phone calls from my GP and text messages asking why I hadn't taken it. I was never an anti-vaxxer, up until this drama unfolded. Now I wouldn't take one ever again.
1	I regret NOT getting the Covid vaccine...
0/0	I regret getting covid 19 vaccine
0/0	I regret getting it because it was worse than having covid. I was up for hours last night w a fever after getting the shot 12 hours earlier.
0/0	I regret getting it. I had covid and in my case it was 1 day of mild fever and 1 week of coughing while my second booster fucked me up for 2 days and nights and made me feel way worse than actual disease.

0/0	I regret getting vaccinated, my health has never been the same.
0/0	I regret it massively, I didnt have chest pains until I got the fuckin thing.
0/0	I regret it too. I feel like I was forced into it. They made medical attention almost impossible if you weren’t vaccinated and I was in a the middle of trying to get pregnant. I’ve now suffer from extreme headaches, heart palpitations, always feel like I’m out of breath and panic attacks- all of which I never experienced prior to this vaccine.
0/0	I regret it too. It gave my heart and vein inflammation. My heart palpitations didn't start calling down until 1.5 years after it happened.
0/0	I regret it, looking back how we all kinda just gave in. We should’ve asked questions. The vaccine was made too quick in my opinion without any long term testing.
0/1/1	I regret not getting it I'm 29 and it's like I have dementia I'm so scared
0/0	I regret taking it
0/0	I regret taking the 1st dose of moderna I got tingling in the feet and my legs feel heavy I just feel weird before the shot I had so much energy. Is not worth it.
0/0	I regret taking the Moderna vaccine. I had a high fever and body aches for two days, and it felt worse than when I actually had COVID.
0/0	I regret taking the first shot, wish i could sue them
0/0	I regret taking the vaccine. It was for a job i really needed. I hope god forgives me
0/0	I regret taking the vaccine. My energy levels have never been the same, and I feel like I aged 10 years overnight.
0/0	I remain happily unvaccinated and I plan on keeping it that way.
0/0/0/0	I remember a time when 50 people died or had horrible side effects, The drug was removed from the trials. Ahhh the good old days when you could actually trust the science and medication.
0/0	I remember all the people who freaked out on me for not getting the shot or wearing a mask.. they called me crazy? Common sense should be labeled as a superpower
0/0/0/1/0/0/0/0	I remember all the people who freaked out on me for not getting the shot or wearing a mask.. they called me crazy? Common sense should be labeled as a superpower.
1/1	I remember around Covid time I started having a really bad cough, coughing up phlegm, mind you I am UNVACCINATED. Everybody kept saying you probably having a reaction to that Covid shot, you got vaccinated didn’t you, blah blah blah. Come to find out it was gluten, I have a gluten allergy! lol so yes sometimes those “vaccine adverse reactions” are just that, a coincidence.
1/1	I remember being amazed when the COVID-19 vaccine was made so quickly, and after watching this, I am even more amazed by how revolutionary this new way of making vaccines is.
1/1/1/1	I remember being amazed when the COVID-19 vaccine was made so quickly, and after watching this, I am even more amazed by how revolutionary this new way of making vaccines is. An applause to everybody who contributed in making and giving out these wonderful stuff. And thank you for the good video.
0/0	I remember being called a conspiracy nutter grandma killer for not getting any injections turns out that's the pharmaceutical industry not me
0/-1	I remember going to the hospital for chest pain (I ended up noticing my jaw had a sharp pain and my arm too when the pain would hit) come to find out it was Myocarditis and I spent a week in the hospital. Worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life and very glad I went to the hospital that day the doctor was telling me that it had gotten to the point I could have died that night.
1	I remember how excessively concerned the US was about Ebola because supposedly Africa wasn't capable of taking care of itself. Now look who's actually pathetically bad at saving their own people.
0/0	I remember not too long ago people were saying 'a vaccine mandate would never happen' and that you're crazy for being worried about it...
0/0	I remember seeing a documentary o YT that in the UK they did this to some people and the long term repercussion didn't show until many years later.
1/1	I remember telling my dad the science of how vaccines worked way back when the pandemic first hit bc his Doc told him he needed the Shingles shot. He's very Republican, but I think he got the COVID shot bc I told him the science before the news cycle really started to vilify it. Sadly, he's super wary of all vaccines now. I can only hope this situation doesn't devolve into something worse.
1/1	I remember the fear on the faces of the grocery store staff who were working at the time when all of us were ordered to be home. The vaccine changed everything - for the better.
0/0	I remember when I was called a conspiracy theorist when I said this was going to be an every year thing like the flu poke.. Glad I've not had any of them nor a flu poke in my life!
1/-1	I remember when the virus first came out, there was no vaccine, and my country was one of the first ones to get messed up by it.
0/0	I remember when vaccines were tested for many years… the good old days.
0/0	I reported to VAERS. Vaccine causes my body inflammation, vaccine placement (too high) caused me inability to move arm, lift arm, at all. I'm a certified clinical research coordinator. I know clinical trials. I am receiving ZERO support to seek medical care. I paid for treatment and PT out of pocket. I LOST more than one year of income and I had no promises that I'd ever be able to reach or lift my arm again! That harmed me financially, and I still have limited range of motion. I took photos, measurements, vitals, recorded my symptoms because it's in my nature.
1/1	I resently got my second shot of the Pfizer vaccine. All I got was a sore arm both times. I was expecting to get a little fatigue but didn't.
1/-1	I respect everyone’s choice, but I wish the debate wasn’t so toxic. Can we have a civil discussion? 😞
1/1	I respect personal choice, but if you refuse the vaccine, don’t expect the rest of us to bail you out when you get sick. 🤦
1/1	I respect that and am sure that is playing a factor. My issue with that personally is that I live really rural, hardly see anyone out here unless I go into town. Since lockdown ended I actually go out and socialise more than I did pre lockdown. Still haven't caught anything but the people around me have. Me and my husband might be naturally immune, who knows 🤷♀️
0/0	I retired four months earlier than I wanted and missed out on a lot of overtime that would’ve helped my pension. Just to prevent being forced to take the vaccine.
1/1	I rolled up my sleeves to get vaccinated, 1 shot ready next July
0/0	I sacrificed my job, and some relationships over refusing to get an untested injection using an entirely new technology (mRNA). Today, I have absolutely no regrets and no vax injuries (and no COVID).
0/0	I said NO!
0/0	I said it before the vaccine was mandated. Make an informed decision, I did the research and sent links. No one listened. I pray that God would reverse the damage in all those who bought the scam.
0/0/0/0	I salute my fellow unvaccinated people. you survived the BIGGEST psyop this planet has ever seen. YOU WERE RIGHT.
1/-1	I saw another YouTube channel in which a woman took her dog to the vet. The vet said, "I have to give your dog a rabies vaccination - it's required by law." And the woman replied, "I don't want you to make my dog autistic!"
1/-1	I saw the results first hand in the ICU only one patient I took care of died of Covid-19 after having been vaccinated. It was a 30 something organ transplant patient.
0/0	I saw this in a movie.... the vaccine appears to be wonderful but then it turns everyone into zombies.
1/1	I saw two homeless guys giving vaccines under the bridge yesterday. We all do our parts, stay safe out there
1/-1	I saw two homeless guys giving vaccines under the bridge yesterday. We all do our parts, stay safe out there.
1/1	I say if one doesn’t get vaccinated, that’s fine. However, if they later catch Covid, they shouldn’t burden the healthcare system. If they do get healthcare after their Covid diagnosis, they should pay out of pocket. They played their hand, now accept responsibility for it.
1/1	I seriously don't get why some people still refuse the vaccine. It's pure science, folks.
0/0	I should NOT have taken the Covid-19 "vaccine", which was an obvious cheap way of getting me microchipped by the Elites of the World.
0/0	I should be able to sue my college for forcing the vaccine and 2 covid tests per week down my throat
1/1	I should say I don't take it as an insult, I am up to get another round next year and I am looking forward to being mostly immunized. Also, petition to rename "anti-vaxx" to "pro-disease"
1/1	I signed up to receive mine though not sure when it arrives here. I really don’t like taking these kinds of things but being older with co morbidities, thought it a smart thing to do. If I grow a third arm in five years, we’ll just have to see
1/1	I skipped the Covid booster last year, and got Covid for the first time. 0/10 will not do again. I’m boosting as soon as I find a place to give it to me
0/1	I smell a conspiracy
0/0	I smoked a doob, I am good, Thanks
1/1/0/1/1/0/1/1	I spent about 7 days in the ER due to Covid and I haven’t been vaccinated personally it’s changed my mind about getting it I’m nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I’m only 26.
0/0	I stand with you. I no longer speak to relatives that called me selfish for not taking Trumps beautiful vaccine.
0/0	I steered clear from it. I was discriminated against by friends, family and work colleagues. I stood my ground, thank god for common sense!
1/1	I still can’t get over people saying “ in my research” when trying to argue with people who went to medical school, which does make them more knowledgeable
0/0	I still don't trust the government pushing this so hard. When has the government ever had my best interests at heart? Feels fishy. 🤨
1/1	I still don't understand how people are more afraid of the vaccine than the virus that's killed 500k Americans🤦🏼♀️
0/0	I still feel emotional pain from the exclusion up till today. I lost family and friends. Lost my trust in the medical world. Before I was helpfull for anyone who asked for help or assistance. Now I quit my volunteer job and stop helping others because people are so mean. I became introvert and feeling a barrier between me and others.
0/0	I still get headaches from the first time . Not going get a booster. Good luck selling this without any deaths.
1/-1	I still have lingering waves of brain exhaustion and physical exhaustion after having it earlier this month. I know it’s not possible but if I could make sure I never got it again -I would! Each time we get it our chances of long Covid increase. And women are more at risk of long Covid … Fing great eh?
1/1	I still haven't had covid. Haven't noticed any side effects. I'll take the unknown effects of a vaccine (if any; we've been doing vaccines for more than a hundred years at this point) over the unknown effects of a brand new virus any day.
1/1	I still support vaccinations.
0/-1	I still think natural immunity is stronger, but I understand why some people get vaccinated. 🏋️
1/1	I still wear a mask. I also get my vaccines. I’m a good patient
0/0	I stopped after my second Covid shot. Started having heart problems (I’m completely healthy) following the shots and after stopping with the shots I’ve not had any issues since.
1/1	I stopped calling them antivaxxers and started calling them pro disease.
0/0	I stopped getting the flu vax almost 14 years ago because it made me sick when I was otherwise fine. Since then, I've never had a flu or any of the symptoms or Covid, and I will never have another vaccine ever again
1/1	I strive to stay on top of all my vaccines. I think they're one of the best things humans have come up with.
1/1	I strongly believe in vaccines
1/0	I stubbed my toe and got a cavity all after getting the covid vaccine. Makes one wonder
1/1	I studied immunology in college. Let me explain to those who don't get it—vaccines are fine and they do help. So don't worry, don't be scared, and don't stress.
0/0	I studied vaccines years ago when I was reading medical sociology. Well known studies by McKweon and McKinley(s). It was obvious that vaccines weren’t as effective as all the propaganda led people to believe. Over the years, I saw safety issues ignored and the public being gaslighted and ridiculed for asking questions. Covid and flu vaccines in particular are non-sterilising. It is an absolute lie that these vaccines “protect others”. There are masses of evidence that MRNA vaccines are a very bad idea, particularly with how invasive lipid nanoparticles are around the body, but organisations like the WHO are ignoring these issues and doubling down on the “safe and effective” narrative.
0/0	I suffered severe prolonged side effects from 2 x pfizer shots in 2021. No way am I having another.
1/1	I support vaccination to protect everyone's health.
1/1	I support vaccination, because it is not only the responsibility to protect ourselves, but also the responsibility to protect the vulnerable groups.
1/1	I support vaccines because they not only help us deal with current outbreaks, but also provide defense experience against new viruses in the future.
1/1	I support vaccines because they prevent horrific diseases
1/1	I suppose I never questioned getting a COVID vaccine... so much as 'which one' I would try to get. I have two elderly parents, one with a compromised immune system, so I had two family members I got to watch go before me.
0/0	I surely do not want this terrible vaccine, making us robots, changing our DNA. First the producers should be vaccinated and then see how they are ruined!!!
0/1	I survived a post vaccine heart attack but have not been the same since I was vaxxed.
0/0	I suspect that even after getting vaccinated, new variants will still infect us, so what’s the difference?
0/0	I suspect that the vaccine data is falsified—the reported effectiveness rate seems way too exaggerated.
1/1	I swear antivaxxers just like being contrarian for fun.
1/1	I swear by the Novavax, and got the first two in May/June. I will be getting boosters asap!
1/1	I swear everyone should get vaccinated, otherwise humanity will go extinct.
1/1	I take everything that's free.
1/1	I teach college Biology. Thank you for this video, it explains how vaccines work. I'll show it to my freshmen students this fall.
1/1	I tested positive for Covid on August 29 and still feel like complete shit. It’s just as bad as when I got it in 2021. Get your booster, people.
1/1	I thank President Trump for the fast development of this vaccine.
0/1	I think I got like 2 boosters two years ago and haven’t since then. Im over it at this point
1/-1/0	I think I may have to go and get my palm surgically removed from my face after watching this
1/1	I think I need 3rd to 4rt doses of pfizer, I feel nothing after taking first to second dose. I'm a super man.
1/1	I think I put anti-vaccers somewhere below flat earthers. At least the flat earthers aren't likely to harm someone.
1/1	I think I'll stick with vaccines
1/1	I think I’ll trust the people who have studied for years to get their medical doctorate and have been in the field and have seen things, rather than the dude who got their information off of a YouTube video and says the entire field of science is wrong. I’m happy to say I’m fully up to date on every vaccine I need! Thankyou to those who run the studies and make the vaccine. Much work goes into these things. As an up and coming medical student I am grateful to be able to look towards y’all as I study. It truly takes a trooper to get through this amount of work and more.
1/-1	I think after years and years of providing facts for all the dumb anti vax talking points actually worked.
0/-1	I think all those automobile accident fatalities listed as Covid deaths probably upped those numbers just a tad.
1/1	I think being vaccinated is better than not being vaccinated ️. Also I work with kids and they are always spreading germs so it’s probs safer for them and for me if I am.
1/1	I think being vaccinated is better than not being vaccinated. Also I work with kids and they are always spreading germs so it’s probs safer for them and for me if I am.
1/1	I think considering the risk vs benefit ratio, I will definitely take the vaccine as soon as possible.
1/1	I think doctors and pregnant women should be first in my opinion.
1/1	I think doctors should have the "right to refuse treatment" to those who inspite of having access to vaccine, didn't take it. After all, that should also be an "individual choice". They should have the "freedom to choose, who they want to treat".That will help free up medical resources.
1/1	I think doctors should have the right to refuse unvaccinated patients like that one doctor.
1/1	I think everyone who can get vaccinated should get vaccinated, and also continue to get boosters against new variants.
1/-1	I think india govt should need to take a serious action on this outbreak of new virus because prevention is batter than cure
1/-1	I think it varies from one insurance to another. I also think insurance companies ought to be mandated to cover however many shots of whatever vaccine someone needs. It’s in their best interest to protect people from getting seriously ill after all.
1/1	I think it will work, just as how vaccine were available for polio, tetanus shot and all the others, don't see the reason why the media is putting so much fear in us
1	I think it would be pretty interesting if anti-vaxxers had some conversations with people from the past who lived BEFORE vaccines were invented and when measles, smallpox, polio or typhoid fever were causing death and suffering everywhere.
1/1	I think it's really sad that the obvious social movements that have caused the sort of anti-sign's behavior, especially from a generation who used to be very pro science, but now we realize was only proscience when was fighting the Russians that they now support. Every antivax person I talk to has the same exact thing in their background that also flat earthers and other conspiracy theories do especially those who are parents. These are people. Many of them are socially entitled by their position or background who have very little control in their lives. Because of that any sort of thing that they can have any sort of authority or control over they take with a maximum force. Because the United States is particular treats children like My parents property instead of an independent human being. It's really easy for parents to just dote on and completely micromanage their children's lives until they turn 18, thus ruining a lot of them. This is also why I find that most anti-vaccine people are moms because they usually live in households in social situations where due to being a woman they are constantly shitted on and they have their autonomy taken away from them. So if controlling their kids health is the only autonomy they have in their lives then they absolutely take it no matter how much it's going to devastate this human being that they gave forth from their body. There's really sad. Part is the small amount of people who push this are obviously making a ton of money drifting off of it. Put those two things together you have a lethal combo.
1/1	I think it’s because the virus mutates, so in 6 months the last vaccine might not be as effective. But yeah seems like it would be better than nothing.
1/1	I think making the messaging more simple might help. Just encourage people to treat it like an annual flu shot.
0/0	I think many people miss the point .... Vaccines are designed to do more than protect from germs ... Now they are causing infertility according to B gates .... we will reduce the population by Billions using vaccines .... Don't be so Daf ... roll up your sleeve and they will know your IQ level .... immediately .... PS .... Not a joke but gin kills more germs and viruses than any shot Punt intended ...
0/0	I think most have come to the realization that the vaccines don't work and there are better ways of managing symptoms.
1/1	I think send the message that vaccination rates are inversely related to education level. Over 96% of docs immunized. That should say something. RN here.
1/1	I think students over 16 should be getting their covid vaccine now if they’re attending in-person classes in high school. Let’s not take the chance of infecting other family members!
1/0	I think that anti vaccination should be considered child abuse. How is a vaccinated adult going to deny their kids a chance at a healthy life. The fact that they are alive and well is proof that vaccination is good for their health.
0/-1	I think that citizens should not rush to get it and be cautious. It could be the cure worse than the disease itself.
0/0	I think that getting the vacine is a horrible idea.
0/0	I think the biggest problem with the mrna vaccines is that they do not stay in the muscle but migrate to other organs. I only had the 2 initial pfizer shots and my dizziness,loss of balance,and feeling like I was not in control of my lower legs finally disappeared after 18 months.
0/-1	I think the main question shouldn't be "how quick? " but "how safe? " Are these vaccines.
0/-1	I think the numbers of people harmed is much higher
1/-1	I think the problem is ultimately the education about these vaccines. The information needs to be transparent, clear, relatable, and easy to understand.
0/0	I think the vaccine is a form of mind control.
0/0/0	I think the vaccine is a form of social control.
0/0	I think the vaccine is a money-making scheme
0/0	I think the vaccine is a violation of my privacy.
0/0/0	I think the vaccine is overhyped, and I don’t believe it’s the answer.
0/0/0	I think the vaccine is unnecessary. I’ve already had COVID-19, and I have natural immunity.
0/0	I think the vaccine will cause more harm than good in the long run. I’d rather take my chances.
0/0	I think there's no point in taking it because the risks are too high
0/0	I think they might actually be cows rather than sheep--they keep talking about herd immunity when we all know the only ones getting immunity is Pfizer (nobody can sue them should their vaccine harm or injure one of the herd)
0/0	I think they might actually be cows rather than sheep--they keep talking about herd immunity when we all know the only ones getting immunity is Pfizer (nobody can sue them should their vaccine harm or injure one of the herd).
1/1/1	I think they should release dose 3 for all ages, so you can take it when it's time.
1	I think understanding the compassion here has helped me a lot. I think I previously fell into the camp of believing that all anti-vaxxers were simply ignorant or misled, but seeing that there can be the statistical unlikelyhoods that affect them so personally, I can see why this would become an emotionally charged issue for them that would lead them to believe differently than what statistics would show. I think understanding their perspective can help people like me to understand why throwing statistics at them doesn't help, and how compassion is the real way to connect with real people
1/1	I think vaccines are one of the best inventions of all time, it cured so many diseases ! Surely one of the inventions that helped humaty the most trought the pandemics that could have killed millions of people
1/-1	I think vaccines that are 15 years and older are ok because of studies plus sanity
1/-1	I think vaccines that were developed years ago, and plenty of research has been shown to prevent disease without negative side effects, then those vaccines should be given. Any newer vaccines without proven evidence should be left to parents to decide what's best.
1/-1	I think we found what happened to the Neanderthals
1/1	I think we should just appreciate how incredibly hardworking these vaccine researchers have worked. Under a Year to develop a vaccine like this is only possible because of the dedication and commitment of researchers. I'm sure these vaccines will save thousands of lives

1/0	I think what makes people more hesitant about the jab, is yes the saftey aspect of it, but probably the main reason would be the coercion tactics employed by governments in collaboration with big pharma and corporations, this big global push to force people into getting the vax, slowly but surely pushing for a global mandate, vaccine passports where you need to show an ID card to prove you have been vaccinated, freedoms drastically reduced for people that do not have the vaccine. It can very well create this kind of two tier society where the people who did what they were told because they were scared into getting the vaccine, looking down upon and excluding people who are not vaccinated. It's going to create a huge divide...they are already doing it in football stadiums where they are separating in much the way as they did with black and white people. Whatever side of the fence you fall on, pro vax or anti vax, I think many would have to agree that this is not the world we should be striving for and be accepting of peoples decisions. I am not anti vax, I am pro choice. I feel like it is your birthright to have a say over what you inject into your body weather it be good or bad substances, your choice. But you should not be exiled from society just because you decided to go against the grain. The human race cannot thrive that way.
1/1	I think you might actually be worse off for having not gotten those shots.
1/1	I thought anti-vax moms were just a meme....
0/0	I thought it was crazy that there were covid vax cards and you couldn’t go into arena or certain places without it. I only ever had to show it once and it was for some stupid sports game.
1/1	I thought it was really cool that my 90 and 96-year-old grandmas were the ones who told me outright to go get the vaccine on the day I was eligible because it wasn’t my right to put other people’s health at risk.
0/0	I thought masks and social distancing worked.. thats better than maybe dying from the experiment
0/0	I thought my side effects were coincidence as well (perhaps early menopause despite no family history of that). But then all the side effects happened the same way and in the same time frame when I got the second dose...only worse. I couldn't leave the house for a month straight. I've otherwise had all my other vaccines and boosters, yet I am not allowed to be critical of Pfizer or tell my story without being shamed.
0/0	I thought they said 70% was herd immunity, so if we are at 75% (or approaching 75%) what's the sudden mandate for Joe?
1/1/1	I thought which ever vaccine u had at first u should have as a booster
0/1	I took 3 doses, then I had heart surgery, so I don't take any more doses, just the flu dose,
1/1	I took a bit of a break, but I'm back and binging the Albans!!!! Congratulations on your first. I also got mine. Looking forward to 2021 adventures.
0/-1	I took a free ride with my kids, As everyone else has reduced the chance for them. I'm from Australia and had my family payment reduced as a consequence, but all 4 kids are healthy adults now. Sounds selfish, but we must think critically about these things.
1/1	I took both shots of Pfizer no side effects
1/1	I took it and had no issues. My partner is a doctor and she was forced to take it and future "boosters". She is perfectly healthy and still doing 5k races. I lost 45 lbs. last year and no longer need Blood pressure medication - eat right and exercise was the key.
1/1	I took it and there is no side effects after one day
1/1	I took it. Been fine since
0/0	I took modern vaccine 💉 on my left arm and I’m having allergic on my whole left side
1/1	I took my J&J shot a few days ago, had a bit of a fever for a few hours but totally back to normal now. Only came here to express how much in awe I am of human achievement. Can't believe how quickly these brilliant minds came up with such an efficient vaccine. Amazing <3
1/1	I took my first dose and only feel a minor pain in my arm.

1/-1	I took my two shots and felt wonderful, invigorated, brimming with vitality. I will be taking my booster shot just as soon as the bartender gets back from his break.
1/1	I took my vaccines so we're done with covid bye!
0/0	I took one dose and one booster because my kids and grandkids pleaded. I didn’t want it. I will never get another booster. If happens again, they have read the data, know the truth, and understand I will not ever succumb to “tyranny” again.
0/0	I took that shot on January 19, 2021, because my federal job required it so we can keep our job. Soon, the medic stuck the needle in my arm and put the vaccine in my arm, I felt a burning sensation go from left deltoid to my head. The nerves on the left of my body be in pain every day. No doctor understands it
1/1	I took the Codid- 19 Vaccine❤🎉
1/-1	I took the Pfizer and no problem at all ,science saving life
0/0	I took the covid vax 2 times and 2 boosters, and I can't figure out why i wasn't injured. They were Moderna and JJ. I won't be taking any more of any vaccine until they are proven safe and effective!
1/1	I took the shot and felt wonderful, invigorated, brimming with vitality. I will be taking my second shot just as soon as the bartender gets back from his break.
1/1	I took the shot because I trust science. The end. 🔬
0/0	I took the two 1st vaccines (Moderna). I had what they "said" were the "normal" side effects. Felt achy all over, arm hurt SO much, just flu-ish feeling for about a week. But, 'they' said it was normal reaction. Then, 28 days after taking the booster, I suddenly could not chew my food without ACUTE jaw pain. Also severe pain over my right ear (temporal area). Felt more flu-ish than ever before, and such acute fatigue, I could barely get off the couch, or out of bed! Turns out, I have Giant Cell Arteritis--Vasculitis. I got referred to a Vasculitis specialist at Cleveland Clinic, from my Internal Medicine Dr. after she immediatedly put me on very high dose Steroids (Prednisone). The Vasculitis specialist told me unfortunately, they are seeing a big upswing in various types of Vasculitis with not only Covid patients, but with people who got the Covid vaccines/boosters... My body had an exaggerated Auto-Immune response to the Vaccines and it now views the presence of them in my system, as "The Enemy". So my body is fighting it around the clock....... I didn't want Covid( I had several friends who died from it). --But this is horrible!! Because the side effects now, from the Steroids are brutal!! But not taking the Steroids would allow my body to release blood clots into my brain, my eyes (causing instant blindness), into my lungs, legs, arms, kidneys, etc... Also can cause Aneurisms. So not much of a choice, right??? I was healthy before all this happened
1/1	I took the two shots and I feel great.
1/1	I took the vaccine and never got covid once. It worked.
1/0	I took the vaccine and now I'm magnetic. Where's my superhero powers?
0/-1	I took the vaccine and now getting numbness in my hands and feet.
0/0/1	I took the vaccine as soon as it was offered due to my age (early 50s) at the time. I am strongly pro vaccine. With that said, full approval absolutely was rushed with Biden pushing for mandates in every sphere of life. Full approval should have taken years so that a full vetting of side effects could be made, especially those affecting certain populations. The benefits of the vaccine for healthy young people compared to risk was not a clear conclusion. The rushing of full approval of the Covid vaccines has likely only increased skepticism about vaccines and governmental edicts. We will pay for this next time....
1/1	I took the vaccine for my elderly parents.

1/1	I totally get your idea and I agree it is scary to get the vaccine. Mexico’s government has also been very shady throughout history like in the US, but getting vaccinated right now is the best chance we got and is very important so we should not spread misinformation.
1/1	I totally trust this science.
1/1	I totally understand the frustration. I tell my families that there’s a reason why we don’t have to worry about smallpox or polio (at least for right now).

1/1	I truly feel if I was not vaccinated my recovery would longer and my sickness would be severe.

1/1	I understand the fear, but medical research shows that vaccines are our best defense. I chose to trust science. 🔬
0/0	I understand when people get the vaccine and then say "oh it was fine I didn't have any side effects" but what scares me is that there could be side effects that don't appear until much later and we haven't had enough time to test that... I don't want to be a guinea pig
1/1	I understand why some people are hesitant, but at the end of the day, trusting science and medical experts felt like the right choice for me.
1/1	I understand why they made the vaccine. It was important to protect the extremely old—the ones with by far the most risk from COVID.
1/1	I understand your concern. However, there's no scientific evidence linking COVID-19 vaccines to infertility. Health organizations worldwide have stated that the vaccines are safe for individuals of reproductive age and do not affect fertility.
1/1	I used to be an anti-vaxxer. But then I realized something the older I got. Our pets get vaccinated all the time for rabies, etc. I was inoculated as a child and so were my friends kids and their friends' kids. Ask a Cellular Biologist if it's a good idea to get a tetanus shot if you put a rusty nail through your foot. Ask about the history of Polio. Basically, talk to a TOTAL expert, not Social Media. I'm begging you, please. Education is key if you want to truly protect your family and friends. Vaccines work, period.
1/0	I used to work for a pharmaceutical company and my dad is a retired VP of a pharmaceutical company. I know how long it takes to get a product to market. And how adverse reactions are supposed to be disclosed. The vax never did that.
1/1/1	I vaccinated mine against COVID as soon as it was available. No side effects, super happy baby, and is still an absolute delight.
1/1	I vaccinated my two oldest as soon as i could. Last year their pediatrician wasn’t offering it, so its been a while for them. I couldn’t find anyone in the area that would vaccinate young kids. This year, i have a one year old. I’ll drive out to where i can find it for them.My middle child was a toddler when he got vaccinated for the first time and it was just fine, nothing out of the ordinary from what you would expect from a vaccine. No side effects besides a sore arm and a little sleep
1/1	I vaccinated my two oldest as soon as i could. No side effects besides a sore arm and a little sleepy
1/1/1	I very nearly died from covid when I'd had no vaccine. I've since had 4/5 jabs. I've also had covid twice since the jabs but the vaccine must have worked because unless I'd tested I wouldn't really have thought it was Covid I'd had again.
1/1/1	I view anyone who was anti-vax and died from COVID-19 as someone lost to conspiracy theories.

1/1	I was a little hesitant at first about the vaccine, but after doing some research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I decided to go ahead with it. The vaccination process was quick and efficient, and the medical staff made sure to keep me informed and comfortable throughout. I’m happy to report that I’ve had no significant side effects—just a sore arm for a day. It feels great to know I’m helping the global effort to stop the pandemic, and I would recommend getting vaccinated to anyone who can.
1/1	I was a little nervous, but the vaccination was quick and painless. The healthcare workers were super kind and explained everything clearly.
1/1	I was a vaccinator when Covid vaccines were first available to health care workers. I had the pleasure of vaccinating an ER resident from another country (I cant recall the country). He was so happy, took pictures and sent them back to his family overseas. We are just spoiled Americans.

1/1	I was actually worried about the vaccine, but knowing they didn't cut corners makes me feel 100% better. Thank you so much for posting it, my family will absolutely vaccinate as soon as we can.
0/1/-1	I was all for the vaccine for at least over 40s but why we were vaccinating children and teens for COVID given the cost benefit calculation, and risk of side effects that is clearly now a greater risk than the extremely low risk from the virus for that age group, I will just never understand why this was done and subsequently brushed under the rug
1/1	I was already taking all the precautions, like masking and social distancing... So it didn’t make sense to undermine all that by holding off on the vaccine.
1/1	I was always repeating to myself that the vaccine is much, much more safe than some random COVID strain we still know nothing about and will know in 10 years, if. My baby got it at 7 months, now she's due for a booster in a month. It was nothing, she just took a longer nap the day after, no red bumpy irritation on her skin, no fussiness, nothing. The worst one was the 2 month vaccine combo to be honest. I am now more scared for the 1 year vaccine combo than this. I was also worried at first, but because of the fact our little baby was the only one who got her COVID vaccine in our town, we are living in a very anti-covid-existence place. my pediatrician even asked for advice from our local epidemiologist. He was confused because the vaccine is approved for 6 months old babies, and just said she can get it. Our ped is usually very covid pro-vax and wears an N-95 mask, just maybe also scared because of the fact she didn't administer it to such a young baby. Which didn't help me lol. She's now vocally recommending it to other parents because she sees a lot of long COVID among kids. Edit: grammar
0/0	I was always taught to say NO to drugs. Thanks but no thanks.

0/0	I was concidering getting the covid vaccine because I planning to have a baby but I'm thinking of not getting it now I'm scared
0/0	I was double vaccinated and got Covid twice. First time before vaccination I was sick for five days at home. I took hydroxychloroquin and came out of the first time just fine. After being vaccinated twice I got Covid again and had to be hospitalized. So much for efficacy. Liars.
1/1	I was doubtful of the vaccine , even though I had to get it against my will for work, it’s still relieving to learn a thing or two about it. I got my first dose 3 days ago. My arm was super sore , but I guess it could be worse. I had the virus back in January and would not want to catch it again.

1/1	I was hesitant at first, but after researching, I decided to get the vaccine. No regrets.
1/1	I was hesitant at first, but after seeing the data and talking to my doctor, I decided to get vaccinated. The process was simple, and I only had mild side effects.

1/1	I was initially hesitant, but after researching the science behind the vaccine, I felt reassured. Now, I feel confident in my choice and grateful for the protection it provides.
0/0	I was labled a "conspiracy theorist" when I refused the jab. Along with plenty of verbal abuse. None of my family have had or will ever have the jab either. So to those people that ridiculed the unvaccinated "We told you so"
1/-1	I was lucky that I didn't catch Covid right when the Pandemic started but I finally got Covid in 2022 even though I got 2 doses of the vaccine and the booster in 2021 I still was pretty miserable when I had Covid at least I wasn't super Ill Like 1 Dislike Reply
1/1	I was nervous about needles, but the whole process was so fast and painless that I barely noticed. The protection it provides is worth every second.
1/1	I was nervous about side effects, but I barely felt anything—just relief afterward.
1/1	I was nervous at first, but after seeing my grandparents and parents get vaccinated with no issues, I decided to go for it. Now I feel relieved knowing I’m doing my part to protect myself and others!
1/1	I was never confused about how the vaccine was supposed to work, because I paid attention to the news. NPR did a good job of keeping their listeners informed. I had 5 vaccines, no side effects, and never got COVID.
0/0	I was never vaccinated, refused to be. I was criticized by the entire company I worked for at the time
0/0	I was not a anti-vaxer until our government tried to kill me with the mRNA Covid 19 vaccine
1/1	I was ok after getting the vccune then I slept today woke up I have a fever N I feel tired but I'm not worried bc my grandma also had the same as me and survived.
0/0	I was one of em and I didn't take it, but my brother took it & died!
1/1	I was one who kept saying, "I'll get it eventually". After seeing John show how easy it is to find a center, I looked up the nearest place to me and got it scheduled while listening. Much love for all you and your team does, John. <3
0/0	I was perfectly healthy before the shot. Now I deal with constant fatigue and weird body aches. Doctors keep saying it’s nothing, but I know my body.
0/-1	I was perfectly healthy without the boosters
0/0/1	I was planning on getting the new one tomorrow after work so I could ride out the side effects over the long weekend. One of my coworkers just went home sick today and tested positive, so now I guess I’ve been “exposed”. Should I wait to see if I get sick before I get the new vaccine? Is there any risk to going through vaccine side effects and illness at the same time?
1/1	I was really iffy about getting the vaccine before this video (would still have gotten one as fast as I got the chance).. But this kinda seals the deal for me to not worry so much :)
0/1	I was scare when I got the vaccine
1/1	I was scared at first, but it was no big deal!
1/1/1	I was sick from Covid last week. My job guidelines said 24 hours and come back to work. I was sick for a week because I wasn’t vaccinated.
1/1	I was skeptical at first, but after doing some research, I realized the risks of COVID far outweigh any potential vaccine side effects
1/1	I was skeptical at first, but after reading the research, I’m confident in my decision to get vaccinated
1/1	I was skeptical at first, but after seeing how many people it’s helped, I got the shot. No regrets!
0/0	I was skeptical before and now I'm terrified of what they are doing. Also no cancer cure yet doesn't make sense to me.
1/1	I was skeptical, but now I’m so glad I got vaccinated!
1/1	I was so happy when my children became eligible for the vaccine. Now, we can travel and enjoy activities together without as much worry.
1/1	I was so overwhelmed with relief that immediately after each Moderna shot, I broke down and cried. I was not alone. I had lost so many friends/neighbors/family to Covid that having the shot was an epic emotional event.
1/1	I was so relieved when my elderly parents got vaccinated. It gave me peace of mind knowing they had strong protection against serious illness.
0/0	I was stupid enough to have the first one. When I politely requested them to aspirate, they refused, I was told to have the jab without it or go away. I now have permanent tinnitus in one ear and weird bruising that appears at random on my arm - both on that side. I also know two people who have died. I don’t know anyone who has got remotely ill from the bug. No more, the NHS can get ...
0/0	I was talking to my mom yesterday after she showed me a gigantic list of things people are experiencing due to the Covid vaccine. My mom is a medical professional.
0/-1	I was thinking of getting the new one and supposedly its only effective for three months
1/1	I was thrilled when my workplace encouraged vaccination and provided easy access to get the shot. It shows that they care about employees’ health and safety.
1/1	I was told I could just isolate myself and not worry about what everyone else is doing... I’m fairly certain the vaccine is the only reason I am still alive.
1/1	I was told my DNA was going to be mutated if I got the vaccine. I felt so gipped when all it did was protect me more from COVID-19. I was fully ready to get super powers and be the world’s newest super vill...I mean super hero. World’s first superhero
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I was unaffected because I never took the poison vaccine.
1/1/-1	I was uncertain about vaccinating my child until I came across this video. Thanks a lot for providing such valuable information!
0/0	I was unvaxxed and still am. No one around me caught. I know my case does not apply all the time but it's proof some people have very solid immune systems.
1/1	I was vaccinated againstt covid, so when I got it, I had sniffles inb the morning, gone by noon. Those not vaccinated died screaming in pain.
0/0	I was vaccinated long ago by the blood of the lamb (JESUS) I will never be vaccinated by any other means!
0/0	I was vaccinated twice and I still got Covid three time and was extremely sick I re fuse the last three shot got Covid and didn’t have half the sickness
0/0	I was vaccinated with both the doses by July 2021, but still I’m tested positive.
1/1	I was vaccine hesitant for awhile since I had covid 2 times and only got moderate symptoms but now with the rise of the delta and other variants I decided to get vaccinated and so far I am very happy with my choice and my ability to look past all this fake news crap about the vaccine!! Now I just gotta convince my dad! Wish me luck
1/1	I was vaccine hesitant... For an embarrassingly long time after, it was spite at the root of it, that kept me going so long. I’m single-jabbed now, with my next dose coming up shortly.
1/1	I was very excited to get the shots done and felt so relieved afterwards. Still feel safe and maintaining health barriers.
1/1	I was very sceptical about taking the vaccine because i have underlying medical issues such as, im a Breast Cancer Survivor, plus, i wantef to get some lab work done . But after listening to Dr King this afternoon, I am going to take rhe first jab. So, currently i live in La Maze Choiseul. Where is the closer medical clinic available so i xan go and take the vaccine please
1/1	I was worried about side effects, but I only had a sore arm for a day. Totally worth it for the protection it provides!
1/-1	I wasn't excited to get the vaccines, but got 4 shots
0/0/0/0/0	I wasn't let down by the government, they did what I expected, I knew they were up to no good. I was let down by my fellow citizens that fell for it and took no steps to research or question the narrative or the product they got injected with......
1/1	I wasn’t sure what to expect from the vaccine, but I’m so glad I got it. The staff at the clinic were incredibly kind, and they walked me through every step of the process. It was quick, easy, and I didn’t even feel the needle go in. I did feel a little tired the next day, but other than that, I had no side effects. The relief I feel now is huge, and I’m happy to know that I’m helping fight this pandemic with every shot given.
1/1	I wasn’t vaccinated for measles. I got the measles during a measles outbreak in 2018 when I was 12 and had been confined in the hospital for 2-3 weeks... Please vaccinate your children.
0/0	I wear no mask I didn’t get the vaccine and I live my life without fear
0/0	I went to doc for cellulitis and they said I’m due for another pneumonia vax. I said absolutely not! I’m high risk and get pneumonia every time I catch a cold but I don’t trust those Mofo’s.
0/0	I went to get my vaccine. I read the disclaimer form and said no thanks. I am not signing that and walked out.
0	I went to my doctor after having covid in January and said that I had covid when he asked me if I wanted a vaccine and he said oh never mind You have natural immunities you're good.
0/-1	I went to my local hospital to have a Cat Scan of my brain, lungs, an stomach. When they injected me with the stuff for the exray the guy gave me the vaccine in my IV without my permission . Now I have all the side effects . What should or could I do about it.
0/0	I went to the hospital to get the vaccine because I needed to travel. Once I got to the nurses office, I realised maybe I prefer not to travel so I don’t have this vaccine.
0/0/0	I went two yrs without getting covid, to save my job, because I worked for a Democrat, I had to get the vaccine or lose my job. I've had Covid 5 times since I got the Poke. I never use to get sick, but since the poke I'm always sick with something. I don't know if it saved lives or killing lives down the road.

0/0	I will definitely not be taking it myself.
1/0/1	I will definitely once it is fully available to the public and out of the testing phase and I don’t have to go out of my way to get it tested on me.
1/1	I will get both the Covid and the Flu vaccine in early November like I have been doing for years now.
1/1/1	I will get it as soon as it is available to us - I believe it is safer than contracting Covid-19! If not enough people get the vaccine, we won't reach herd immunity and be able to get back to a more normal life...
1/1	I will get it if there is one for me to get. I work in hospital and also the first time i got covid i was really sick that end up in ER so i don’t want to repeat that event, i would rather get a shot and be safer.
1/1	I will gladly take the vaccine tomorrow if I could. Just my way of telling other people that I value their lives!!
1/1/1	I will have 2 weeks after The updated vaccination 2024-25. Thursday after NEXT. @ my age &amp; circumstances. The 8 previous and annual flu vaccinations. Has kept me out of the hospitals.

0/0	I will never get the vaccine
1/1	I will never question the incredible and life-saving vaccines - Polio, Small Pox, Whooping Cough, Measles and Mumps, etc. Also, the meds that allow people with HIV to survive. That was a death sentence. 99.97% o people die of Rabies, if not treated. Thank you, Pharmaceuticals.
0/0	I will never regret the decision to NOT take that shot.

0/0	I will never take that shot! I will never trust CDC again

0/0	I will never take this shit
0/0	I will never take this vaccine and neither will millions of others. We, the people, are in charge, not the elite! Only let people take the vaccine if they wish to.
0/0	I will never take this vaccine not in my life time. This agenda is evil those taking it put their lives in danger. I will rather advice people to receive Jesus not vaccine I have seen many videos of their evil agenda Africa be wise they lied to your ancestors now they came with this strategy to wipe us this was how they used the selfish leaders of our ancestors to sell their people into slavery please don't be ignorant. If you post a video of their devil agenda, they never approve it, they will block it this is the reason you are not seeing any bad video about the vaccine. They are lairs please avoid it Africa. One African president get vaccinated yet he tested positive. I pray God open our eyes
0/0	I will never trust this rushed vaccine.
0	I will never, ever again allow the government to bully me into injecting myself with synthetic genetic material. Pfizer’s 2 shots gave me a heart arrhythmia at age 34. LEAVE US ALONE
0/0	I will not be vaccinated, vaccines should not be prioritized over therapeutic drugs, and the government should focus more on COVID-19 treatment options.
0/0	I will not comply.
0/0	I will not get it. This was pushed through by Trump
0/0	I will not get the covid 19 vaccine. I do not deny the science; I am just against the government forcing you to do something.
0/0	I will not take a Vaccine and i dont want that cause my Body my Choice
0/0	I will not take one, nor will any of my kids. They will get natural immunity.
0/0	I will remind you all that unvaccinated survival rate of covid-19 is above 99%. It’s a decent odds for me.
0/0	I will say it has been hard to exist with a vaccine passport to separate everyone in society, and then to find out those vaccinations did not help stop the spread at all from vaccinated people
1/1/1	I will share my experience. I got my second child vaccinated at six months (my first got vaccinated as soon as it was available and had the booster no issues). That night he threw up violently and repeatedly. We weren’t sure if it was related or not. I’m in Canada and before anyone would give his second dose, they had us meet with a paediatric allergist. He ruled out allergy to the vaccine ( he suspects fpies). He said a true allergic reaction to this is so incredibly extremely rare. Even in those cases there are measures they can take to still get vaccinated in some cases. We ended up getting the second shot with no problems at all so it definitely wasn’t an allergy. Just a tired baby for a day or so. Not even a fever.
0/0	I will stand for none of this. Never trust pharma or the governments that are trying to enforce these covid vaccines. Also sick of people pushing or shaming others who are wise enough to not fall for this.
0/0	I will take a pass. I'm more comfortable with my natural immune system within my body, and will not be joining the scary march. Enjoy your new invention, hope it works out for you

1/1	I will take it
1/1	I will take it...
0/-1	I will trust god before I trust the government and the shot that they mixed up
1/0	I will wait for the world to get vaccinated so that I come out of my home freely.
1/1	I will when it is available to me. I work with a lot of people that are older then myself, I have a daughter which requires therapy (which puts her into contact with a lot of people), and finally, I believe in vaccines--it's an amazing time to be alive.
1/1	I will, but not the first round
0/0	I wish I had waited. Too many unknowns with this shot.
0/0	I wish I hadn’t gotten it; I was tricked into getting three shots, and now I’m suffering from vaccine side effects—diseases I’d never experienced before are all showing up.
0	I wish I never had it. Since the darn vaccination I get sick two to three times a month and I mean sick. Before that I used to get sick once every two to three years and it was the common cold.. my immune system is ruined.
0/0	I wish I never had it. Since the darn vaccination I get sick two to three times a month. … My immune system is ruined.
0/0/0	I wish Michigan would do this. COVID-19 vaccine caused me to have three strokes. Im on warfarin and have been since 2016.
1/1	I wish everyone would get vaccinated so we can move forward.
1/1	I wish more people trusted experts instead of social media. There’s too much misinformation out there. 🧐
0/0	I wish people had been told about the possible dangers of the inoculations. So glad I didn't take it though
0/0	I wish that they had medical professionals who were on the anti-vax side.
0/0	I wish these guys had spoken and advised me instead of the so called doctors; my body has never known peace ever since i took the jab.
0/0	I wish they would stop calling this science project a vaccine
0/0	I wish they would stop saying that the vaccine poison side effects are RARE. because they are not rare. just not reported !!!
1/1	I wish we all worked together as one and we all get vaccinated all around the word to finally end this virus . Together as one we will beat if we don't we can't beat this virus so let's all work together as one humanity to finally beat this virus.
1/1	I wish we could convince our friends and family to get a Covid booster. I’d feel a lot safer seeing them if they did, and I don’t want to watch them get sick. 😥
0/0	I won't be vaccinated because someone around me has serious side effects after vaccination, which scares me.
0/0	I won't ever have the vaccine nooooo way
1/1	I won't feed my child because he might choke
0/0	I won't take it; no way
0/1	I won't take one without knowing the long term risks, and that takes at least 7 years to determine.
1/1	I wonder how anti-vaxxers view Jehovahs witnesses' stance on refusing blood transfusions? Would they be critical, or would they be supportive?
0/-1	I wonder how much they paid you to say all this ....
1/0	I wonder if people were saying my body my choice to the smallpox vaccine. Or polio vaccine
1/1	I wonder what the ppl who are against this “new” vaccine technology will say if it ends up being able to cure cancer.
0/0	I wonder why anti vax kids are so much healthier? Say no to covid vaccine
0/0	I wonder why many are skeptical and doctors say it could possibly be the catalyst for new deaths. I’ll wait... see what October brings.
0/0	I wont be putting this crap in me or my children no way no how we will take our chances with covid
1/0	I wont believe vaccines are necessary for my lifestyle.
0/0	I won’t trust it.
1/1	I work as a middle school teacher and got Pfizer again, I’ve had like 3 Moderna boosters. And the two Pfizer ones I’ve only been tired with a sore arm. I’m so glad I got it, the wave hasn’t been as bad as last year at work but it was a necessary move to make
1/1	I work as an ER nurse and we have to work 12 hour shifts all because people refuse to get vaccinated, pleaseee get vaccinated
0/0	I work at a hospital and I will quit if they try to mandate it. I always opt out of the flu shot too.
0/0	I work at a hospital and see the heart problems in those vaccinated
1/1	I work at a nursing home so for me it was obvious to get vaccinated
0/0	I work in GI and there’s a huge increase in patients with unexplained abdominal pain, nausea and/or vomiting. To the point that some go to ER but no diagnosis found. Typically around 4 months after the 2nd shot. Moderna more so than Pfizer, but seeing both. How many people are experiencing health issues months later but not connecting it to the injections!? These are healthy people in their 20’s-40’s, otherwise!
1/1	I work in RNAi based Gene Therapy research. Don't forget that when you contract a virus and it replicates in your cells you're also exposed to all of its mRNA anyway, and any potential off-target effects. So if you're going to get exposed to the spike protein mRNA by vaccine or natural infection, I'd pick the one that protects me and the people around me from a potentially deadly disease.

1/1	I work in a pharmacy so I will be getting every vaccine available.
1/1	I work in a public school and am immunocompromised. I wear a mask in public anywhere from the first day of school to the last day of school and in airports and on planes. I'm also fully vaccinated.
1/1	I work in an elementary school so I'm getting vaccinated against anything these kids are bound to try to pass along to me.
1/1	I work in healthcare and I can attest that vaccinated people are doing much better than unvaccinated ones.
1/1	I work in healthcare and have seen the devastating effects of COVID-19 firsthand. Getting vaccinated is a crucial step in ending this pandemic.
1/1	I work in healthcare, and the difference the vaccine made was HUGE. Waaay fewer severe cases
1/1	I work in healthcare, so I got the second shot already in February. I've worked a lot with Covid... but I've made it through this difficult time...
1/1	I work in healthcare. Am around covid constantly. Fully vaxxed and boosted, haven't got it yet.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I work in healthcare. Get your influenza and covid vaccine or you wear a mask from October to April.
1/1	I work in long-term care homes with at-risk elderly patients, I just got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday. I hate needles and all the conspiracy theories out there freaked me out, but I'm putting my trust in the scientists and scientific evidence. I also want to keep my old people safe <3
0/0	I work in mental health and have had two people in the past two months talk about being severely ill after taking the covid vaccine. One of them had a brain infection! I had one jab because i felt pressured, then i ended up with heart issues for a while and have had extremely irregular periods every since. it was so bad at first i thought i was seriously unwell. I put two and two together, realised it was the vaccine and never had another.
0/0	I work in research in academia and this is called coercion, and is unethical in research. However all that seemed to go out the window for the sacred vaccine.
1/1	I work in the mental health field and I believe that everybody that works in health care or other types of professions where you work close to people with a weaker health should take it. Or don’t work in that field.
1/-1	I work in vaccination clinics in Canada and it's really apparent Canada's turn around in rollout. When I first started it was extremely slow and shifts were being cancelled due to lack of doses available. Fast forward to today and the clinic I was at had 7200 appointments today.
1/1	I work on the covid Front line since 9t hit the uk. So yes If i get it offered I will take the vaccine if there is a chance I protect the people I love and care for.
1/1	I work with a lot of people every day, and getting vaccinated just made sense. I can't afford to be out sick for weeks or bring something home to my family. No regrets at all!
0/0	I work with pediatricians and family doctors every day. I have never seen one single case of long covid. What I have seen and treated in ICU various times are side effects from the vaccine however. Kids should never have been vaccined. Ever.
1/1	I work with vulnerable people, and the vaccine helps me keep them safe.
1/1/1/1/1	I worked as a COVID ICU nurse in a large urban hospital during 2020-2021. Not to be morbid but I put so many patients into body bags, I’ll be in therapy forever lol. You can bet my six month old just got the COVID vaccine.
1/1	I worked as an ICU nurse at bedside throughout the entire pandemic, in Florida. The amount of patients in my ICU struggling so hard to breathe… screaming at me that it’s “just the flu you people are lying about COVID” while watching FOX… saying “I didn’t get the vaccine because you don’t know what’s in it”… when we get to the point of intubation they beg for the vaccine (too late).
0/0	I worked in healthcare from the 80s- 2010s and this does not surprise me at all. The US healthcare system is broken because of greed.
0/0	I worked in the Emerg and could not believe how many young mothers were coming in with miscarriages after getting the Vax! It was shocking.
0/0	I would NEVER trust a Pfizer product. They hold the record for the biggest fine ever paid by a pharmaceutical company ever. Says a lot about their ethics.
0/0	I would bet that if real long term studies were done that they would show that ALL vaccines create less health.
1/1	I would definitely vax up before cruising!
1/1	I would get one every month if they recommended it. I believe in science.
1/1	I would get the Vaccine, as soon as it is available for me. Thank you Dr. Jordan for what you are doing on the front line, and for taking your time to make videos to educate us.
1/1	I would have gotten the newest COVID vaccine, but it wasn’t out in time for me. I’m on immunosuppressive medication and I have to time vaccinations very carefully around my treatments. I can only get vaccinated 8 weeks before a treatment or 12 weeks after a treatment. So there’s only a three week window twice a year when I can get vaccinated with any type of vaccine. The flu shots were ready, but COVID was a week too late for me. I think I’m going to be social isolating at home most of this fall/winter.
1/1	I would have less of an issues with anti-vaxers if they were consistent. You don’t get to refuse a vaccine and constantly deride doctors and public health experts but then go to the hospital when you get COVID and expect the doctors you constantly deride to save you. You shouldn’t be allowed to have it both ways.
1/1	I would like to get my 12 years old to get vaccinated
0/0	I would like to know what happens in 5,10,15 years? What are the long term effects of untested vaccines? I guess only time will tell.
1/-1	I would never in my life vaccinate my children. I would let the doctor do it, much safer
1/1	I would never take advice from a random Boomer stranger who watches Fox News.
1/1	I would never want medical professionals who aren’t vaccinated working on me
0/-1	I would not be clapping !!!! I am Saddened by this , They show you this , But if she starts showing any kind of side effects you would see or hear about that
1/1	I would openly challenge anyone who says "The vaccine is worse than the disease".
1/1	I would probably get it but I’m not in the first wave of folks of who need it!! Would anyone else get it?!
0/0	I would rather go to prison than take that poison!
1/1/1	I would rather trust doctors and scientists than some reddit nerd lol
1/1	I would rather trust science than social media rumors!
0/0	I would say forced. I WAS a Paramedic in Australia until I refused the vaccine. My wife had her own Physiotherapist clinic until she refused the vaccine. As a "medical professional", and one who suffered from the loss of my career. I can categorically say that telling someone to inject an untested "vaccine " into their body or loose their career is the definition of "forcing" someone! It also breaks the benchmark of medical ethics "first do no harm and informed consent. It WAS absolutely forced on people!!!! And we need to hold that up as the most agreagous sin of this whole dark era.
1/1	I would take it just to protect my loved ones
1/1	I would take the vaccine today if I was designated a priority I believe and the scientific and medical consensus believe the vaccines are safe and effective COVID-19 is a much more significant worry and makes agreeing to vaccination obvious
0/0	I would to love to have the vaccine, but I have an allergy to authoritarianism.
0/-1	I would wait 6 months to see how it affects people.
0/0	I wouldn't give my kid that poison
0/0	I wouldn't take a vac without an antibody screen follow up in 4 to 6 wks....no one knows how long immunity lasts from the vac. I'll wait.....I have life long natural immunity from other diseases...preferred.
0/0	I wouldn't take the vax for a million free hamburgers+fries OR donuts
0/0/0/0	I wouldn't take the vax for a million free hamburgers+fries OR donuts.
0/0	I wouldn't take this vaccine. The body heals it self. If they attempt to force anything on me, trust me, we will have a BIG PROBLEM.
0/0	I wouldnt want to join a fully vaccinated group not because of physical health, because of the mental stability of those around me.
0/1	I would’ve rather have been wrong about this than right. If I was wrong, at least it would’ve been my life at risk, but now I know almost all of my loved ones are at risk and it outweighs the care I have for my own survival. Just wish they would’ve listened.
1/-1	I&#39;m going to get my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine with my mom at a retail store that my dad worked at 33 years ago in October 1989 after Thanksgiving 2022. PLEASE wish us luck.
0/0	I'M NOT TAKING YOUR EXPERIMENTAL VQX! YOU MAKE IT YOU TAKE IT!
1/0	I'd love to know the outcome of y'all's study! Did presenting the facts about vaccines and COVID to those who chose not to get vaccinated encourage them to get the vaccine?

1/0	I'll pass
0/0/0	I'll pass. I'm young with no conditions, I eat my greens, and healthy everyday and never missed work or school growing up because of my strong immune system. I worked through covid and felt great the entire time...... so I think I'll take my chances lol

0/-1	I'll skip the first round let me know how it works.
0/0/0	I'll stay home thanks, my body my choice 😊 Work online, pay with crypto, get ahead of the game 🙏 good luck everyone
0/0/1	I'll stick to my current list of vitamin supplements and healthy diet. I have been exposed to people tested positive and i haven't felt ill at all. I also work in retail and at this point i'll take my chances.
0/0	I'll stick to my own immune system since it works better than this. Statistics show that my immune system protects me against most pathogens, while this newfound thing often adds debilitating ailments.
0/0	I'll stick with my own system of wellness, thank you
1/1	I'll sub. I'll even take half pay. I'm a vaccinated 41 year old, 5'6" white guy who used to play in high school. Put me in coach.

0	I'll take vaccine after 10 years
0/0	I'll wait 6 months and watch how all you sheep make out with it before I take it
1/1	I'm 100% pro vaccine (although against mandates) and I've gotten vaccinated and trust that it's safe.
1/1	I'm 16 and I got my vaccine 2 days after my 16th birthday, this is so important guys, you can do this!!!
1/1	I'm 16 years old, and I have taken the Pfizer vaccine. I didn't have any side effects on my first shot, but I did have a sore arm for the second shot. The pain disappeared a day after taking paracetamol.
1/1	I'm 21 and have no health problems and not immunocompromised and have both diesel of moderna
1	I'm 27 and fully vaccinated since February because I work in a hospital. A huge benefit for me has been the freedom from the anxiety of getting myself or others sick. It's such a relief. DFTBA! - Don't Forget To Build Antibodies!
1/1	I'm 27. Just got my second dose yesterday, don't feel great but it's livable. Please get it. We want this pandemic to end so we can work on the next crisis.
1/1	I'm 58yrs. Old... After Receiving Both of My Covid Vaccine's. (MADERNA) I Felt Like The 6 Million Dollar Man!!! Now I Have The Body of A 25yr. old!
0/1	I'm 58yrs. Old... After Receiving Both of My Covid Vaccine's. (MADERNA) I Felt Like The 6 Million Dollar Man!!! She'll Be Stronger, Run Faster, Exercise Without Pain Etc. Now I Have The Body of A 25yr. Old! My Thoughts Are Those of BIBICAL WISDOM... Need I Say More?GREAT NARRATIVE VOICE!!!
1/1	I'm 65 and High Risk..I've had both shots and am feeling fine..get out and get in line..get your shots and Live Again..
1/1	I'm 68 and got both Pfizer shots. 1st was middle of March & 2nd the middle of April. Both shots were No Fuss, No Muss. No side effects, reactions or anything.
0/-1	I'm 74, unvaxed. Over these 3.5yrs, I've spent much time in crowded homes, apartments, offices, businesses, events, cars, buses, & trains. I use diet, supplementation, exercise, rest, sleep, & socialization to stay well. c100 of my vaxed friends, relatives, neighbors, & acquaintances, have had COVID, many severely. I've remained disease-free.
0/0	I'm 79 no vaccines no covid coz God care for me and He is my vaccine
1/0	I'm African American. I took the vaccine and developed a "common" reaction to the vaccine. I developed skin rash and itchy skin. The Dr. tried to say it was skin neglecta, but I told him it was the vaccine and I walked out and slammed the damn door! But, luckily I was able to treat it with some Dove unscented soap and Vaseline skin cream. It soon went away. Overall, I'm still glad I received the shot, but I wish they would tell you these things upfront.👍
1/0/1	I'm Australian so it's basically compulsory. I will be getting novavax. I'm not going to be the one getting pericarditis.
0/0	I'm Soo proud to say my family is UNVACCINATED!!!!!
1/1	I'm a 50-year-old diabetic. Covid has me in its crosshairs more than most, so hell yes, as soon as this is available to me I'm lining up for it.
1/1	I'm a biomedical scientist. These last 2+ years have been very frustrating to me and my colleagues -_- Doctors and medical scientists who don't work for a pharma don't gain any benefits from you getting the vaccines they advertise or the precautionary actions you can take. Just, please, listen to them...
1/1	I'm a cancer survivor... if you listen to most people who are voluntarily unvaccinated, you will notice one common thread: they never talk about the virus or its symptoms or what a death from Covid looks like.
1/1	I'm a medical doctor. Getting vaccinated in time really helps fight COVID-19, even its variants.
1/-1	I'm a medical writer that works with pharma companies. I see years of research get rejected by the FDA...with lots of positive results and peer reviewed publications. It's not easy to get approved.
1/1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow.
1/1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose tomorrow.
1/1	I'm a nurse and the idea of a vaccine being available soon is so exciting, I don't work on a covid floor but it still is having a huge impact on my patients and my work day.
1/1	I'm a person with autism and even if vaccines did cause autism l I'd rather deal with the autism than covid.
1/1	I'm a person with autism and even if vaccines did cause autism l I'd rather deal with the autism than polio.
1	I'm a physician assistant, also, and I got my first shot yesterday. Piece of cake. Just sayin'..
0/0	I'm a real gentleman when it comes to vaccines. I always say "You first"
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I'm a real gentleman when it comes to vaccines. I always say "You first..."
1/1	I'm a school bus driver and I was able to get my shots pretty early, thankfully to the school district. It's important, folks, I've had coworkers die from Covid.
0/0	I'm a wait an see kind of person. I'm not having the vaccine until I know it's safe may never get one
0/0	I'm actually surprised why people don't doubt these vaccines in the first place.
1/1	I'm afraid that antivaxxers are poorly educated and can't think critically, hence their concerns have no merit during a global pandemic
0/0	I'm against vaccination
0/0/0/0/0	I'm alive today and did not get the vaccine
1/1	I'm all for vaccination & am patiently waiting my turn
1/1	I'm all for vaccination, but it's just annoying as hell how Reddit tries to shove their anti-vaxx hate down my throat...
0/-1	I'm allergic to vaccine when I first got it
0/0	I'm already plagued with illnesses, and getting another vaccine shot will really kill me.
1/1	I'm also a pharmacist. I diligently read research that was available about covid vaccine and I've concluded that not only are they safe but incredibly effective in reducing severe hospitalization rates and mortality.
1/0	I'm also curious. What data are you looking at that counters the narrative: it does more harm than good and reduces risk and degree of long covid. Obviously it has issues with efficacy and reducing transmission and we don't know exactly how long the spike proteins replicate and shed. But I'm also asking in earnest: what is your go-to, peer-reviewed data and statistics that you would use to make your case?
1/1	I'm anti-breathing because there's a lot of air pollution and I might get sick.
1/1	I'm assuming the traditional vaccine is Novavax. I don't know anything about this upcoming formulation but the previous Novavax shots were just as effective as the mRNA ones.
1/1/1/1	I'm autistic and fully vaccinated. Even if I believed there was a connection to the vaccines I was given to how my brain works, I'd rather have shitty social skills than die.
1/1	I'm autistic, and even if vaccines do cause autism, I would rather be this way than not be on the spectrum. I have talent , and my friends support me. I have autism for a reason, and that reason IS. NOT. VACCINES. And their saying that they would rather have their children, someone who (they say) that they love and care for, DIE than have this condition that I have lived with for my entire life, I am greatly offended.
1/0	I'm bombarded with people telling me why they wouldn't get the vaccine. It's nice to hear a voice of reason
1/-1	I'm clinicle approved.thats a must. Vaccination .
0/0	I'm concerned about potential long-term side effects of the vaccine.

0/0	I'm concerned about the reports of heart inflammation in young males after getting the mRNA vaccine.
0/-1	I'm concerned about the safety of preservatives.
0/0	I'm concerned about the side effects being downplayed by health authorities.
0/0	I'm concerned about the speed at which these vaccines were developed. Were they tested thoroughly?
1/1	I'm confident in the safety measures taken during vaccine development.
1/1	I'm conservative and my wife is on dialysis in a center with people from nursing homes. They asked her if she wanted the vaccine. Shes pretty scared about it because it's new and shes worried about future kidney transplants. I've seen what fellow Republicans say about the pandemic and vaccine, but I've also seen what they have said about January 6th. I told her to get the vaccine....
0/0/0/0	I'm curious, if this type of vaccine works so well, why do we keep needing booster shots? Can someone with medical background explain it to me? Thanks
1/1	I'm definitely more scared of covid and would do it yearly if I had to.
1/1	I'm definitely so much less terrified of going to the store now that he's got a few rounds of vaccines under his belt ?? Thank you!!!!
1/1/1/1	I'm definitely taking it
0/0	I'm done with all vaccines, "experts" and all authority.
1/1	I'm excited to see concerts and events return, thanks to vaccination.
0/0	I'm expecting an apology from any friends who treated me unfairly for not taking this crap!
1/1	I'm experiencing a low grade fever after yesterday's vaccine. I'm sure it will pass. all together 5 jabs since their roll out!
0/0	I'm facing a terrible dilemma. Either get the covid vaccine or drop out of nursing school with only months left. I simply wish to defer getting this vaccination until there is sufficient evidence of long term adverse effects and a clear indication of overall risks. Healthcare workers should not have to forfeit the right to choose the drugs they put in thier body. We are not the villains.
0/1	I'm free from this deadly COVID virus and comfortably living healthy, I'll always testify to this
1/-1	I'm free from this deadly COVID virus and comfortably living healthy, I'll always testify to this,thanks.
1/1	I'm from India n today I stood in line for 4 hrs to get a shot after trying for 3 days to register. Don't get complacent guys, we did n now are suffering like crazy
0/0	I'm from October 2023... let's just say the C19-vax is not selling like hot cakes anymore. And it doesn't prevent transmission at all so no, you are not selfish for not getting one.
1/1	I'm from Phillippines i got 3 vaccine shots
1/1	I'm from the Philippines, I don't think there was a universal distaste for vaccine during the pandemic. Everyone that I know wants to be vaccinated. The only problem is that the majority wants vaccines from the west and actively avoided the vaccines from China.
1/-1	I'm fully vaccinated and I now have super strength! The vaccine has given me the super ability of being able to spot sore Trump losers from a hundred miles OR I can even predict when they are going to appear on my Facebook feed! It's amazing!
1/1	I'm fully vaccinated and boosted. I have COVID right now! It feels like a mild cold.
1/0	I'm fully vaccinated and boosted. I have COVID right now! It feels like a mild cold. The first time I got COVID was before I was vaccinated. I got a lung infection and coughed so much my throat bled. I felt like crap for months afterwards.
1/1	I'm fully vaccinated and boosted. It gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm less likely to get seriously ill if I catch COVID-19. Plus, it helps protect those who can't get vaccinated.
1/1	I'm fully vaccinated and boosted. It's reassuring to know I'm less likely to get seriously ill.
1/1	I'm fully vaccinated now. It's a very good feeling
1/1	I'm fully vaxed and encourage everyone else to get the vaccine.
1/0	I'm generally pro vaccines, but I can empathize with those who are hesitant or resistant.
0/-1	I'm getting a lot of the same uncited talking points I've seen over and over again, and I'm noticing more and more conspiracy theorists jumping in.
1/1	I'm getting all of the recommended vaccines, which includes covid. Seeing babies get a spinal tap because they got sick before a certain age does something to a person. If they get certain illnesses before 4 months of age, it's an automatic hospital stay and spinal tap, so if I can help make sure my own child gets as many protections as possible, I'll do it.
1/1	I'm getting my 2nd dose of 5G microchip covid vaccine in a couple weeks. Can't wait
0/0	I'm glad I didn't get the covid scamccine
1/1	I'm glad I got both shots what's the problem
1/1	I'm glad I got it and the boosters. I only got Covid-19 once (so far) and it was pretty mild.
0/1	I'm glad I retired early at the beginning of the pandemic. No employer can tell me I have to inject a foreign substance into my body to keep my job.
0/0	I'm glad I stood firm and said NO to the 'Jab'. I just wish so many friends and family members didn't fall for it.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I'm glad I trust my gut feeling, the pharma industry is absolutely evil. I have companies still denying me just because I'm unvaccinated, its crazy
1/1	I'm glad I vaccinated, now I don't need my silly cellphone to track my movements.
0/0	I'm glad I was 'warned' before falling for taking the jab. My friends in Canada were jabbed and the side effects were strange. Then my friends father died within a week of taking it. He was just fine before taking it. His legs swelled up, breathing problems, strange rash....and he died with lots of pain. RIP
0/0	I'm glad I'm not getting anymore vaccine. I made that mistake last year because I'm was scared and paranoid when my pops died from COVID. Nobody in my home is never getting vaccinated again. We didn't get the flu shot last fall or the COVID shot and we not this year.
0/0	I'm glad my family doctor said I didn't need the vaccine.
1/1/1	I'm glad that you, as an adult, took the responsibility of getting vaccines to protect or lower the risk for yourself and others.
1/0	I'm glad to see that there are some countries that are placing the health and safety of our kids above the profit margins of big pharma.
1/1	I'm going in for my fourth booster shot tomorrow and have, thus far, stayed COVID free. I haven't had any major vaccine side effects.
1/1	I'm going to ask my doctor first but yes, I will. 👍✨
1/1	I'm going to be honest I felt completely fine after receiving my first and second dose of the vaccine
1/1	I'm going to be honest I felt completely fine after receiving my first and second dose of the vaccine .
1/1	I'm going to fund an educational project to help everyone understand the benefits of vaccines.
0/0/0/0	I'm going to slow down on talking to family and friends who keeps bringing this shit up about taking a shot . It's becoming mentally draining
1/1	I'm gonna get every vaccine and become immortal
0/-1	I'm gonna wait to make sure we don't have a I am Legend situation then I'll get it.

1/1	I'm grateful for the vaccine; it played a crucial role in ending the pandemic
1/1	I'm grateful the vaccine kept my grandma from developing severe symptoms!
1	I'm grateful to be part of the solution by choosing to get vaccinated!!!!!!!!!
0/0	I'm happy that I never got the clot shot.
1/1	I'm happy that people are really trying so hard to save our lives and we are really thankful for this amazing news may we all be healthy and safe
1/1	I'm happy to contribute to community health.
1/1	I'm happy to contribute to herd immunity by getting vaccinated.
1/1	I'm happy to live in such a modern tech society. With vaccines, internet/information.
0/-1	I'm here because I can't breathe
1/0	I'm hesitant to get the COVID-19 vaccine because I'm concerned about potential long-term side effects.
1/-1	I'm hoping and praying for a vaccine for my grandchildren who are under 5 years old.
1/-1	I'm impressed by all these armchair PhD doctors that seem to know what they're talking about. Who would have ever thought there were so many?
1/1	I'm impressed by the global cooperation to develop these vaccines.
0/0	I'm in phase 1b but I won't be getting it and neither is my wife who is a nurse and almost none of the nurses that work with her are getting it either!
1/1	I'm in. Boost me up, doc!
1/1/1/1/1	I'm just glad that there is a vaccine now.
1/1	I'm kinda looking forward to the delicious irony when all these anti-vaxxers start dropping in a few months. Can't even feel bad for them at this point.
1/1	I'm looking for any anti vaxxers in the comments because I need a laugh
0/0/0	I'm more comfortable with my natural immune system within my body, and will not be joining the scary march.
0/1	I'm much more worried about the side effects of when I got COVID than from my vaccine.
1/1	I'm much more worried about the side effects of when I got COVID than from my vaccine. I had sides effects from COVID for months, I had no side effects from the vaccine
1/1/1	I'm much more worried about the side effects of when I got COVID than from my vaccine. I had sides effects from COVID for months, I had no side effects from the vaccine.
0/0/0	I'm never going to take covid vaccine personally I think there's no point in taking it because the risks are too high and I don't want to live on taking a booster shot every 6 months
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I'm never going to take it personally I think there's no point in taking it because the risks are too high and I don't want to live on taking a new one every 6 months

0/0	I'm not afraid of covid I'm afraid of vaccine
0/0	I'm not an anti vaxxer I have gotten all of my required vaccinations for school, however I've never gotten a flu vaccination and I've never had the flu. There is no way I'm taking a vaccine that only took 1 or 2 years to make
0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12months is giving me doubts. So NO!
1/1	I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I am up to date with all my vaccines thank god.
1/-1	I'm not an antivaxer or anything. I'm really excited for this technology being used at this moment. But i think that is important for future reference, to disclose that it was also accelerated in the testing phase due to the emergency of the situation, being even quicker to develop.
1/1	I'm not an ati vaccine, in fact, I'm vaccinated too.
0/0	I'm not anti vax but this vax has something fishy going on so I'm anti covid vax.
1/1	I'm not anti vax, as people love to say, I'm pro choice, for every medical choice there is. It's up to you, just make educated choices.
1	I'm not anti-vaccine and understand the efficacy for older populations, but feel I get labelled as such for asking questions about my own health
1/1	I'm not anti-vax, I'm pro-vaccine not just for my safty but also of those around me.
0/0	I'm not antivax at all but I will stick with the old adage, if it ain't broke, don't try and fix it.
1/1	I'm not antivax, though I have my reservations about ut. However, I'm still getting it when I can
0/0	I'm not even joking, I know someone who was perfectly fine then had the astrazenica vaccine, felt terrible, went t hospital and was diagnosed with leukaemia, at 60 years of age. What is with that shit?
0/0	I'm not even taking one of those doses, you expect me to get one every year?
0/0	I'm not going to be a lab rat! No shot for me ! Nice try??
0/0	I'm not having the vaccine
0/0	I'm not hesitant I know I'm not having it
1/1/1	I'm not just "pro vaccine" for the sake of it, I just don't want people to get horrible infectious diseases!

0/0	I'm not taking it
0/0	I'm not taking it lmao
0/0	I'm not taking it. I know black doctors and nurses who feel the same way. That's who I am choosing to believe. These people have managed my healthcare highs and lows, and never a problem.
0/0	I'm not taking that shit period
0/0	I'm not taking this I had the coronavirus and I didn't go to the hospital I used home made remedies and I got better God truly healed me
1/1	I'm not up to date because the side effects are quite extreme for me, but I'm glad those around me are taking up the responsibility and staying vaccinated.
0/0	I'm not vaccinated and I don't plan on it.
0/0	I'm not vaccinated, got covid, yaaaa, am still here.
0/-1	I'm not. I got my vaccines back in 21' largely because I was forced to. COVID isn't really a threat to Millennials as it is to boomers. Now that I am not required to show proof of vaccination just so I can go to a restaurant and enjoy my succulent Chinese meal, I won't get one.
0/-1	I'm not. I will continue to get a flu shot, but I got 4 covid shots, was horribly sick for 36 hours each time, and also got covid for each time I got the shot (and was very symptomatic). I'm not saying people shouldn't, but I'm going to abstain this time around.
1/1	I'm old enough to remember when avoiding covid was a pain in the ass because we had to wear masks all the time and avoid contact with others. Now we can just get the shot and move on with our lives! It's amazing!
1	I'm on my second dosage, I had to call off of work and I've been falling asleep all day. My body aches and I did get the chills. Hopefully this will be over soon
0/0	I'm one of these vaccine's side affect victim, before get vaccinated i just fine and health, just after vaccinated i feel something different in my body feel like i don't recognize my own body like before, after around couple months i get stroke, hypertensi and my anxiety get worse at 38, i don't wanna vaccinated actually but my goverment forced me Is there any cure to reverse of this, i wanna my health back just like before vaccinated
0/0	I'm perfectly healthy without it..
1/1	I'm personally pro-vax and pro-vaccine choice
1/1	I'm planning on getting it for my baby as soon as he's old enough and will get one for myself at the same time as flu shot.
0/0	I'm pregnant and refuse to take it. Even my GYN told me don't take it.
0/1	I'm pro vaccine, but I'm kind of on edge on this one. If you want to take it, wait for results and see if it's safe enough.
1/1	I'm pro-vaccine because the science and history speak for themselves
1/1	I'm pro-vaccine personally. The science and historical data is too overwhelming to argue with. However, I am also pro-choice and disagree completely with forcing mandatory vaccinations. If someone chooses not to get vaccinated, they risk their own health, not others. Saying unvaccinated people endanger vaccinated people is absurd; all that does is devalues the vaccine itself.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I'm proud that I didn't get a single jab, it was an absolute nightmare with pressure from friends, family and work. I'm sorry, but I'm honestly proud of myself that I stood my ground!

1/1	I'm ready to get vaccinated! Is there a number where I can register for the vaccine?
1/-1	I'm really excited for this technology being used at this moment. But i think that is important for future reference, to disclose that it was also accelerated in the testing phase due to the emergency of the situation, being even quicker to develop.
1/1	I'm relieved my elderly parents are vaccinated; it eases my worries.
0/0	I'm relieved they didn't make the vaccine mandatory. No vaccines for me.

0/-1	I'm skeptical about the COVID-19 vaccine's safety. It feels rushed, and I want more data before deciding.
0/0	I'm skeptical of the data supporting vaccine safety.
0/0	I'm so , so, so, so sad that I got the shot. I feel so stupid, I was brainwashed.
1/1	I'm so GLAD the US recommends it for everyone, otherwise people like me (not in a high risk group) wouldn't be able to get the insurance to cover a vaccine that I want to get.
1/1	I'm so excited to go back to normal! I'm tired of wearing masks...
0/0	I'm so glad I didn't let anyone pressure me Into to having this poison injection.
0/0	I'm so glad that I listened to my gut instinct and refused that poison!
1/1	I'm so grateful for the vaccine. It gave me peace of mind knowing I'm protected and helping to protect others.
1/1	I'm so grateful for vaccines.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
1/1/-1	I'm so hungry after getting vaccines.
0/0	I'm so sorry for all the individuals here that were convinced or cohersed into taking this vaccine. People really need to band together and push back against this.
1/1	I'm sorry I no longer have compassion for those unvaxed patients, they take the beds of truly innocent and sick people. You make the decision you deal with the consequences.
1/1	I'm sorry, I don't feel badly for these people. I feel badly for my friend who was so careful and afraid to get it and died within 15 days because she had asma and the vaccine wasn't available yet.
1/1	I'm still blown away how quickly it was developed. Vaccines/Boosters are usually years, not months. We live in very exciting times.
1/1	I'm still breastfeeding, and I love the thought of passing COVID antibodies to my baby.
0/0	I'm still here to see 2025 without the vaccine. I will never take their vaccinations.
0/0	I'm still not getting the covid-19 vaccination. It hasn't gone through the rigorous testing that other vaccines have had to complete in order to go to market. The CDC can shove that "vaccine" up their #$%^!
0/1	I'm still to know one person who died from it
0/0	I'm suffering side effects I hurt everyday
1/1	I'm super pro-vaccine! Love 'em!
0/0	I'm sure that the child that wasn't vaccinated, also lives WITHOUT polio but nice try at attempting to sound smart
0/-1	I'm surprised YouTube has not removed this video.
1/1	I'm taking it. In fact I was on the Moderna trial (but I am pretty sure I got the placebo). I'll take the vaccine as soon as I can.
1/1/1/1	I'm taking it. In fact, I was on the Moderna trial (but I am pretty sure I got the placebo). I'll take the vaccine as soon as I can.
1/1	I'm taking the vaccine so that I can visit my grandma without worrying so much
1/1	I'm thankful for my vaccine, I got infected with covid two and a half months after being fully vaccinated. I could feel the virus trying to get into my lungs, but before I knew it, it was over with.
1/1	I'm thankful for the healthcare workers administering vaccines tirelessly.
1/1	I'm thankful for the healthcare workers who administer vaccines.
1/1	I'm thankful for the healthcare workers who made the vaccine accessible to us.
1/1	I'm thankful for the researchers who developed these life-saving vaccines.
0/0	I'm tired of this!!!! U can still get Covid after being vaccinated!!! I seen it!!!!
0/0	I'm unvaccinated and very happy with my decision. I didn't have any financial repercussions due to my decision. It's so sick that people had to choose between supporting themselves and their families and getting the shot.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I'm unvaxxed. I caught covid but it lasted less than a day. Work gave me 2 weeks paid leave so I went on a holiday. My cousin was vaxxed and had 2 boosters. She caught covid and was bed ridden for a month. Poor thing
1/1	I'm up-to-date with all my vaccination +5 shots of Covid vaccine.
0/1	I'm upto my 9th booster. Only had covid 7 times. I can't wait for my next booster but the doc said I should wait a bit for the pain from the myocarditis to ease off a bit. Luckily the stroke after the 5th one was only mild. Those free donuts with every jab were lovely. Well worth the wait queuing in the rain to get into that vaccine trailer in the McDonalds car park.
1/1	I'm vaccinated and agree with that the science we have says the vaccine is safe.
1/1	I'm vaccinated and boosted
1/1	I'm vaccinated and boosted 😎
0/0	I'm vaccinated twice but again I am sick also i hope I'm not with covid 19 but.....🤔🙄
1/1	I'm vaxed and it saved my life...
1/1	I'm vaxed and it saved my life....
1/1	I'm very much pro-vaccine, but I understand there are plenty of understandable, sensible reasons to be cautious about having the covid vaccine. Why do these groups always go straight off the deep end, instead?
1/1	I'm watching this while my (unvaccinated, multiple-comorbidity, newly anti-vax) mom is having trouble breathing because she has 'pneumonia' and doesn't want a doctor to tell her she has 'c-19'. I might lose a parent because of this misinformation. So frustrating that I can't convince her to see a doctor or get vaccinated.
0/0	I'm worried about potential long-term neurological effects of the vaccine.
0/0/0	I'm worried about potential unknown side effects that might show up years later.
0/0	I'm worried about the impact of the vaccine on fertility, especially since there hasn't been enough research on it.
0/-1	I'm worried about the impact on fertility.
0/0	I'm worried about the ingredients used in the COVID-19 vaccines.
0/0/0	I'm worried about the long-term effects of the vaccine since it was developed so quickly.
0/0/0	I'm worried about the potential for vaccine-induced diseases or conditions.
0/0	I'm worried about the pressure to get vaccinated and the consequences of not complying.
0/-1	I'm worried about the vaccine causing autoimmune diseases.
1/1	I've already had the first dose and the side effects weren't much, just a thick head the next day, way worse was the 2 weeks I spent in hospital with covid
1/1	I've also had every booster on schedule since the vaccine came out. I'm also here in 2025 and I've never had COVID either. Same for my husband.
0/0	I've been a nurse for 40 years. Unvaccinated and proud of it.
1/0	I've been following discussions where people talk about experiencing long-term health issues after vaccination.
1/1	I've been fully vaccinated for over a month now. I'm happy to have done my part, but sad that so many others have either been unable to or simply chose not to get vaccinated. I fear that if COVID continues to spread like it currently is, a new variant that can bypass the vaccines will be formed. Fortunately the current vaccines seem to still work against the Delta Variant, and I'm confident that more effective vaccines will be available in the future
1/1	I've been getting them with my flu shots
1/1	I've been ok just restless not too bad tho going on second day after the first shot.
0/0	I've been safe for 18 months now without the vaccine. I'm pretty sure I can manage without it until this is over (if it ever will be cuz I'm not so sure it'll end anytime soon)
1/1	I've been trying to convince my mother to get her vaccine for a while now. She says I'm "bullying" her because I take the time to explain how they work and counter the misinformation she keeps repeating.
0/1	I've been using a religious exemption for my kids for all CDC vaccines and will continue using it.
1/1	I've been vaccinated willingly against many things over the years and fully support implementation of covid vaccine, I find it fascinating how anti-vaxxers refuse to see the advancement medical science has made and continue to live in stone age.
1	I've been vaxxed twice. First with J&J and just got Pfizer last week. My whole family is vaxxed including my 12-year-old son. The company I work for has over 300 employees and everyone is good since their shot. I have not heard from a single person that I know personally of any issues with any of the shots. Did we feel a little crappy for a few days? Yes. Sure did. That was it. Nothing a day on the couch can't cure.

1/0	I've come across information suggesting that natural immunity is better than vaccine-induced immunity, so I'm not sure if I need the vaccine.
1/1	I've done my research. Real research, not YouTube videos. I got the shot. 🧐
1/1	I've got it when i wad 15. Im 16 now. It has been very very helpful! I haven't got Covid since. Thank you for this video :D
1/1	I've got the Pfizer vaccine first dose yesterday. I haven't felt anything weird at all.
1/1	I've got to say I'm also super pro vaxx, but I also have had anxiety when taking my daughter to get her vaccines. That big scary "but what IF" in the back of my head. I consider myself a reasonable person and follower of science and even I've had that fear so I can see how some slide down the slope into lunacy about them.
1/1	I've got to say I'm also super pro vaxx, since its studied for long time.
1/1	I've gotten both doses, I'm pretty happy
1/1	I've gotten my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, getting my second dose on Monday the 25th. Really feeling lucky that my job has provided it. I am a caregiver to the elderly.
1/1	I've gotten my moderna shots.
1/1	I've gotten the vaccine and all the boosters(had to for work). So have many of my family and friends. No one I know has had any problems, other than a sore arm. As long as your baby has no preexisting health conditions everything should be fine. If you're worried I suggest getting screening done prior to vaccinating and setting up a checkup afterwards. :)
0/0	I've had 2 covid vaccines, and I've been suffering from more infections and ill health than my previous record of 15 years with only 2 - 3 days off work due to sickness.
0/0	I've had 3 and regret it everyday. Only good thing is I wouldn't let my kid have it

1/1	I've had COVID, and trust me, the vaccine is much better than the disease itself!
1/1/-1	I've had all 3 Moderna vaccines and I've never died. :)
1/1	I've had all three shots but they were expiring so I got my first shot again today after a year I just felt sleepy tired but I'm glad I did it cuz I like to get out places I don't want to wear these stupid mask anymore I'm glad I won't be for getting this done they should yeah but if you get to cut it by her she's going to feel a lot worse all you really feel is a little bit of tiredness maybe a headache I didn't have much problems at all with the first and second the third one I went to bed and slept for hours with the third one a couple of hours is all
1/1	I've had an aggressive variant of the flu without a vaccine. Nearly killed me. Couldn't eat for 5 days. I've never had a vaccine do that to me. I'll take the vaccine, thanks.
1/1/1	I've had both jabs and got it 2 weeks ago, felt shit for a day but wasn't too bad after the first day. The vaccines work and stop it from mutating.
0/0/0	I've had covid 3 times. No complication, no "long covid", nothing. And didn't take the covid vaccine. Coincidentally, I don't have heart problems either.
1/1	I've had covid 3 times. No complication, no "long covid", nothing. And i took the covid vaccine. Coincidentally, I don't have heart problems either.

1/1	I've had just 2 shots, had a sore arm and a mild headache for a day, have had no problems, feel great
1	I've had mine every year; never gotten Covid. I figure it's inevitable that I will eventually catch it but trying to put it off as long as I can.
1/1	I've had my EU vaccination passport in my wallet since I got it in June. Not rocket science, somebody built a web page that scans the QR code and builds a pkpass file out of it. Also works on Android with a corresponding app.
1/1	I've had my vaccine shots every year; never gotten Covid.
0/0	I've had pronged side effects for over a week. I'm just being told my body is doing what it's suppose to do according to research but I'm definitely in pain .
1/1	I've had several boosters. I will get another in October
1/1/1	I've had the Moderna vaccine... didn't even notice it. Thank you VA for taking care of us veterans over the age of 65 !!
1	I've had the first & every single booster. I'm still around & in excellent health.
1/1	I've had the original Covid shot and four booster I think. I kind of let my guard down and earlier this year I finally got Covid. It was not bad at all, took about 10 days to test negative. I will still be getting Covid boosters.
1/1	I've had the vaccine.
0/0	I've had zero shots, never had Covid, and I'm here in 2025.

0/-1	I've just tested myself, and it's come up that I won't be requiring any vaccine !!
0/1	I've listened to you, now get into the vaccination chamber!
0/0	I've lost my brother suddenly. No cause of death in PM or samples sent off to the lab. Just got results of coroner's inquest no obvious cause of death. The COVID vaccine is the only thing we are left with. But who cares we are expendable
0/-1	I've met drug dealers that don't push this hard.
0/0	I've never ever had the flu shot in my lifetime. I've also never had the flu. I know I'm just one person but still.
0/0	I've never had a flu shot, I've never had the flu. I'm also not vaccinated. I've been exposed to COVID 5 times and tested negative all of those times. My most recent was being quarantined with my girlfriend. She got COVID from her friend, who is vaccinated, my girlfriend is also vaccinated. In the 10 days I was quarantined with her I never got COVID. I did 4 tests throughout that 10 days before I was able to go back to work. I'm convinced the vaccinated are the problem at this point, not sorry to say it. I consider myself lucky, however, I'm not the only one with similar experiences. Let's go Bradley..
0	I've never had a single covid jab. I'm still here. Never had covid.

0/0	I've never had covid. I've had ZERO vaccines.
0/0	I've never had the vaccine and I've never had covid 🤷🏼♀️ do with that what you will. I stopped getting the flu shot 4 years ago and have only had the flu once since. I used to get the flu once a year.
0/0/0/0	I've never heard anyone, except politicians, say good things about the mRNA vaccines. We don't want any of them. Why are they still being rolled out????????
0/0	I've never needed a vaccine for a cold before.
0/0	I've not had a single vaccine or booster or PCR test. I'm here in 2025. COVID doesn't exist.

1/1	I've only got a sore arm the same as when I have the flu vacation, can't wait for my 2nd on 2nd May
1/1	I've only had a reaction to a vaccine once. I was covered head to toe in hives, and I'm STILL pro-vaccine.

0/0	I've read reports of adverse reactions. I'm not convinced that the vaccine is safe for everyone

0/0	I've read that the vaccine can cause autoimmune diseases.
0/0	I've read that the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission, so why bother?
0/-1	I've seen conflicting information about vaccine efficacy.
0/1	I've seen first hand vaccine injuries (blindness) and death. Pro vaxxers refuse to believe it because mainstream media won't report it
1/1	I've seen people suffer from COVID. The vaccine was an easy choice.

1/0	I've seen videos of people having severe tremors after getting the vaccine, and it's really scary.
0/0	I've spoken to doctors who are refusing the vaccine so...
1/1	I've taken every pfizer vaccine/booster available and managed to not get covid until now.
1/1	I've taken my first dose and will have the next one in 3 weeks. It feels natural to take it even though I've had Covid-19 twice.
1/1	I've taken the first injection
1/1	I, just like you, felt a little apprehensive about the shot. I also know they're good, but there was that little doubt in the back of my mind. Well, LO got the shot yesterday and literally cried for 30 secs. He was back to being his happy self after that. Still no side effects. Honestly, seems like the shot was easier on him than the 2, 4, and 6 month shots. Hopefully this provides you some peace of mind. You're doing the best for your LO!
1/1	IDK the numbers but my unvaxxed dad died of covid. He was only 59
0/0	IF the vaccine is so good for you, why are vaccine manufacturers NOT LIABLE for any damages or death from their product? It's all on you, if you get it and no one cares...
0/0	II didn’t know people were still getting the shots after all those terrible side affects.

0/0	IMMUNE SYSTEM. gfy
1/1	IT HAPPENED TO ME WHEN IT REACT THAT VACC8NE. BUT AFTERWARD ,IT WAS NO MORE BAD, EVERYTHING ALRIGHT NOW, WITHOUT VACCINE CAN NOT PROTECT HUMAN BEING. IF SAFE , WHY NOT. THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFRAID TO HAVE VACCINE, BELIVE IN ME THEY WILL HAVE PROBLEM FOR THEIR FUTURE. IF ALWAYS THINKING NEGATIVE.
1/1	IT HELPS PROTECT THOSE WHO CAN’T GET VACCINATED.
0/0	IT SHOULD BE A PERSONAL CHOICE, NOT A MANDATE.

0/0	Iceland is vaccinated in 71% and there is a lockdown because people get sick, I think something is not working ..
0/0	Id rather catch the virus with a 98% survival rate then get that poison vaccine
1/1	Idiot anti vaccers! Get a life
1/1	Idk why ppl act like this is some crazy thing. It’s a shot. We been gettin shots our whole lives.
0/0	If 80 millions are not vaccinated, there's still hope for humanity. May they stay that way!
1/1	If Americans do not want the vaccine, send their share to poor countries who cannot afford them!!!
0/0	If COVID brought you here, don't get the vaccine, the REAL chances of dying from COVID is less than 1% (Unless you have an autoimmune condition). All the vaccine (Which is actually gene-therapy and not really vaccine) seems to be doing is causing blood-clouts, nausea, headaches and in more severe cases - Strokes, Blindness, Seizures and Death.
1/1	If COVID had no vaccine, people would be BEGGING for one lol.
0/0	If COVID was so deadly, why did 99% of people survive?
0/0	If Covid is real? How come I haven’t been able to catch it. I’ve been trying for over a year.
1/1	If Covid-19 vacines where tied to so many bad stuff as you said, I would be dead already three times at least.
0/0	If I even had a thought of getting the vaccine, that totally made up my mind to not get it
0/0	If I get sick, I’ll deal with it naturally.
1/1	If I had a negative reaction to a particular medicine, it wouldn't mean that I would refuse all medications.
1/1	If I had to make a pro-vaccine pitch to unvaccinated people, it would be that a recent vaccination is the most protective, so now is basically the perfect time to get vaccinated as we head into the winter but waiting until November would probably be too late
1/1	If I hadn't been vaccinated I know I wouldn't be here.
0/0	If I have had Cov-19 before. then whats the worry about getting it again. my body can fight it. I would rather let my body do it's job than put some foreign chemicals into my blood stream
1/1/1	If I owned a business, I'd mandate vaccinations... Because I would care if my employees lived or died...
1/0	If I'm allergic to peanut doesn't mean that peanut will kill everyone I won't become an antipeanut activist now just replace peanut with covid vaccines.
1/-1	If Republicans could read, they’d be very angry
1/1	If Trump says the vaccine is good, it has to be true! :)
1/1	If a global pandemic killing millions isn’t enough to convince you to get the vaccine, if 95% of hospitalizations being unvaccinated isn’t enough to convince you, if full approval of both vaccines by the FDA isn’t enough, just what are you waiting for?
0/-1	If a person hasn't come into contact with covid and gets the vaccine, is there any possibility that the vaccinated person can transmit covid through the vacinnaiton alone?
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	If a person or government is forcing you to do or take something, you don't have to do any research or prove anything, just refuse it by default, because they want to hurt you.
1/0	If a vaccine makes you question the government, but junk food doesn’t, rethink your priorities.
0/0	If a vaccine was effective and harmless they would not have to market it.
1/1	If all governments world wide offered only moral support and sympathy to those with family and friends who suffer from covid or died from it...we would be saying the government is doing nothing as people continue to get sick and die... BUT World wide vaccines are being made and FREELY issued, death rate is not as it was when covid first appeared, covid is still spreading, lower death rate.....YET we say don't force me to take a vaccine that you the government or the producers know little about...clearly there isn't enough time to study something so aggressive...but we want future effects...point is people simply cannot be satisfied
0/0	If all of those people really died from COVID, how come there isn't a boom in affordable housing?
1/1	If an antivaxer catches covid and becomes ill, I do not want my taxes to pay for the treatment?
1/1	If and when she gets ill with covid I hope she takes some aspirin and go to bed! Stay away from the hospitals !!!
1/1	If antivaxxers get sick, I hope they can just stay home. Don’t go to hospital, cause there’s no cure for stupidity…
1/-1	If anyone is getting the Pfizer make sure to clear your schedule for the few days following the second dose just incase. I had some nasty side effects and the doctors said it happens in about 50% of people. They’re bearable but you can’t really go about your day having them
1/1	If anyone refers to it as “the jab”, just dont give them the time of day. Theyve been on youtube conspiracy theories and wont care about facts/data.
1/-1	If beds are short, they should have a criteria for people they decide to treat. Those who simply refuse to get vaccinated, should be low priority.
1/1	If benefits outweigh the risk then 100 shots should be 100 times more beneficial. Go ahead, and good luck.
1	If cult idiots don’t want vaccinations…don’t get them ..showing your ignorance by laughing , just makes you look stupider
1/1	If doctors and scientists are getting vaccinated, that tells me all I need to know.
1/1	If everyone did their part, we wouldn’t be in this mess.
0/0/0/0	If everyone knows atleast 2 people that suffered serveer side effects, it's hardly rare.
1/1	If everything go well, in the beggining of next year we will have a vaccine!
1/1	If got effected with the disease , the severity will be less , when once protected with complete two doses of vaccination.
0/0	If he had a Covid infection which killed him, it doesn't say much for the vaccines he'd had. And if the vaccines killed him, likewise. Either way, the vaccines don't exactly come out of this very well.
0/-1	If he had not taken the vaccine, would he be still alive today?
0/0	If he really wanted everyone to be vaccinated he would guarantee no harm by removing the protection the manufacturers have against lawsuits.
0/0	If i could go back in time, I would never have taken those shots 😡. Now im a cripple 😑.
1/1	If i have a chance to take the vaccine then i am taking it
1/1	If it comes to my country I will take it gratefully. Without a second thought
1/1	If it helps even a little, I took the vaccine and it feels nice knowing that my body is ready to deal with the virus just incase I catch it
1/1	If it helps protect me and those around me, why not?
1/1	If it helps save lifes, why wouldn't you take it???
1/-1	If it is a scientific fact that the mortality rate is one percent, then the actual covid cases would probably be almost twice what has been tested and discovered.
0/0	If it is only about 68% effective against severe illness, that doesn’t make me feel confident in getting it as someone of higher risk.
0/0/0	If it is that simple then why are there so many people suffering severe side effects & why are so very many reputable & highly qualified doctors warning us not to take it? I don't get it.
0/0	If it was about health, they wouldn't censor doctors.
0/-1	If it was really about health, they’d focus on exercise and nutrition.
0/0/0	If it were so safe this early, then why did our obgyn forbid my pregnant wife from going anywhere near it, due to the likelihood of losing our baby even at 8 months of pregnancy
0/0/0	If it worked, why do vaccinated people still get sick?
0/0	If it's causing issues with some people short term then it MAY cause issues with all people long term.
0/0	If it's possible that profit might be an incentive for folks in the alternative health space, is it also possible that profit could be a potential incentive for large corporations manufacturing pharmaceuticals?

0/0	If mRNA vaccines are easier to produce (yet not easier to store aparently) then why is this the first one that has been approved for widespread use, ever?
1/1	If my nurse was an anti vaxxer, I would rather run out of the hospital than be treated by her
1/1	If my parents ever were anti vaccine, when I became able to choose whether if my parents can chose my health care, I would of gotten vaccinated, nothing would change my mind. Vaccines have saved my life too many times

1/1	If natural immunity is so great, why did so many people die?
1/1	If natural selection was real-time, it would look exactly like the anti-vax movement.
1/1/1	If none of you get vaccinated, the COVID pandemic will never end; it will keep fleeing from one place to another like the world's most notorious fugitive.
1/1	If none of you get vaccinated, there will be another big outbreak.
1/1	If not for the vaccine, my COVID case could’ve been much worse!
1/1	If one doesn’t believe in science just go home and treat yourself
1/1	If only all these people had the same concerns about food,illegal drugs and alcohol as they so about a vaccine that is 99.99% safe we would be a hell of a lot healthier.
0/0	If only people would keep taking the vaccines so that Pfizer and Moderna don't go broke. People have no consideration for these companies that saved the world.
1/1	If parents choose not to vaccinate their children that is fine because that's their right. But, parents who don't vaccinate their children need to respect the rights of schools and daycare to refuse service to individuals who don't adhere to the regulations and rules to enroll. Parents who don't vaccinate their children need to find schools and daycares that allow non vaccinated children
0/0	If people are dying and getting all kinds of illnesses, diseases and miscarriages after the covid vaccine, the vaccine IS NOT proven safe.
0/0/1	If people are uncomfortable with with our medical condition, that’s their problem. There has been NO medication, medical procedure, or treatment that comes with zero risk. People even die from taking Tylenol because of liver damage. Does it mean that I shouldn’t tell people to take Tylenol? No. But it does mean that people should be aware of the risks of Tylenol so they can decide for themselves. The CDC has lied to make it seem like it’s virtually impossible to get injured by this vaccine even though over medications from companies like Pfizer including things like their ED pills all have side effects or adverse reactions. This is not some magical vaccine that is different than all other vaccines. There are people who get injured and we need to admit that so people can get help, and so we can reduce the injuries next time around by learning from what caused them. The CDC also says that you should wash your hands to avoid covid even though it’s airborne. There’s a lot of public health messaging that’s botched here. And because of that, people like me and you are unable to get medical care because people think we’re conspiracy theorists for taking a vaccine that we supposedly are supposed to hate? Nah lol. We signed up to get it, we are NOT anti-vax!!
1/0	If people are willing to to die for what they claim is their right to not get vaccinated. Bye bye.

0/0	If side effects were rare, I shouldn't know more than one person who had some. I know at least 5, and I am an introvert with very few friends.
0	If someone suffers a serious adverse reaction, will the manufacturer or government compensate them? No way.
0/0	If that is normal and safe - why no producer or government's or doctors would like to take responsibility if somthing happened to the patients Furthermore consent form is required

1/0	If the vaccine was really dangerous, wouldn't politicians be avoiding it instead of promoting it?

0/0	If the vax works, why do we need boosters every 6 months??
1/-1	If there has been anything that COVID has done in the last 2 years. One thing is that it certainly revealed the stupidity in our society i was unaware of before the Pandemic.
0/0	If there is a face of devil, it is you people! You create a hoax called corona which has ripped many lives apart (as far as economics is concerned) because your end game is to vaccinate people with poison!
0/0	If there was a push to test children to see before they get vaccines if they are allergic then there would be much less vax injuries. Everybody is diffrent and the fact they are universally perscribed should should be a red flag.
0/0	If there was just one vaccine, tried and true and without any complication in the future, sure maybe I would get the one vaccine. As it is, my own immune system has served me well all of my life. I'd rather not offer it any new "developed at record speed" anything. Seriously, there are already too many pollutants to deal with every day.
0/1	If there were serious side effects, these clowns wouldnt tell u anyway
0/0	If these vaccine are so wonderfully effective and safe, why all the fanfare? Why are people televising vaccinations? Why has the government agreed to give away free weed if you get vaccinated? Why has there been a cartoon created to convince people of color to take the vaccine? Then, they say it’s still possible to get a Covid. It’s still possible to spread it. You still have to wear a mask. You still have to stay six feet away from others. So what DO the vaccines do? Lull people into a false sense of security. Death and disease are a part of life.
1/-1	If they are only producing a new vaccine once per year, aimed at the December/January surge, then we are unprotected from this summer surge.
0/0	If they are that safe the these companies should have zero problems with taking all responsibility with them! Right now they get a free pass! Also we still have little data on long term side effects down the road!
0/0	If they gave me $1 million I would not take the jab. My immune system is my greatest asset.
0/0	If they lie about one thing, they will lie about a lot more. There was a lot of lying done by regular doctors and nurses who shoved masks in our faces. The trust is just gone. They haven't even made the attempt to apologize or make up for all the wrong that was done.
0/0	If they make the vaccine mandatory for travel... Well It was fun while It lasted!
0/1	If they offer the Vaccine to me Iâ€™ll give it to these guys and theyâ€™ll have extra protection.
0/0	If they were listening to people with adverse effects instead of gas lighting them and making it impossible to share their stories, this would have been a "duh" as soon as the vaccine rollouts happened. My best friend has been so affected by the vaccine.
0/0	If they were so safe why was the Astra Zeneca vaccine "withdrawn", and why does the NHS not offer the vaccine to children any more?
0/0	If they're scared of this virus, they can take all the precautions they want for themselves. We don't have to indulge in their fear and paranoia.
0/0	If they're so confident the vaccines are safe, then they should be subject to liability. They won't be until 2024, under the Emergency Use Authorization designation
0/0	If they're so effective why do we need 4 shots?
0/-1	If this experimental gene therapy is so safe effective why do they feel the need to mandate its use? and destroy the reputations of DoctorsScientists who simply want to treat covid patients in the early stages of infection to save lives as doctors should...
0/0	If this has been studied for years and is better, why are we just now using it?
0/0	If this is so safe - why aren’t the pharmaceutical companies held liable as other companies are, please explain why so many young healthy people are being buried ?

1/1	If you look at infection numbers abroad, they are usually something like 90%+ unvaccinated. Here, the number is closer to 70% vaccinated, which is about the ratio of people that are vaccinated. What I think is happening is that we are testing a lot of people, and because we have powerful contact tracing, we are testing a lot of unsymptomatic people. This is not the case almost anywhere else. I think what is happening elsewhere is that a ton of vaccinated people are getting infected but showing no symptoms at all, or very light symptoms, so they aren't getting diagnosed.

1/0	Ignorance is the most dangerous epidemic
1/1	Ignore boomers who watch Fox News when it comes to any health advice whatsoever. I got another shot for the new variant as soon as it came out. I had Covid once and it wasn't terribly severe, but it still SUCKED. I don't need it to be worse than that if I don't have some protection from severe disease.
1/1	Ill be getting the vaccine once I know it's safe. I have a serious medical condition and I've had bad reactions to past vaccines.

We would still have polio, smallpox, rotavirus, pertussisg around, if there were as many conspiracy theorists around then as there are now, in this age of misinformation and scientific illiteracy.
1/1	Im 30 years old. I got the Johnson and Johnson shot 2 weeks ago. About three hours after the shot I felt flui-sh for the next twelve, then I felt perfectly normal. At least from my perspective, the vaccine is safe.

1/1	In 2017 I wasn't able to register to clases because I was missing my menginitis shot, I dont see a problem for UNIs to require the covid vaccine and feel should be handled the same way. Specially when an outbrwak could mean throuble for the college

1/1	In 2022 the World Health Organization (WHO) in India supported efforts to improve health systems and vaccinate children and pregnant women. The WHO also investigated a vaccine-derived polio virus found in sewage in Kolkata.
1/1	In Argentina, schools cant accept non-vaccinated children, end of the problem.
0/-1	In August, for the first time, we both developed COVID. I had the sniffles and a cough. She had a bad headache and heavy congestion as well as well as a cough. I was ill for about 4 days, her for 6
1/1	In Belgium, almost everyone is vaccinated. A few don't want it, but they are alone in our society. Thanks to the vaccination, we can now live normally again. A few more people are getting sick but our hospitals can handle it. We go again (without masks) to parties, weddings, movies, ... life is back to normal.
1/1/1	In California, they better hurry up with that vaccine so we can get this place back to normal.
1/0	In Canada, too 😞. Unless some people are directly affected, they don't give a crap/believe it's real. It's so strange. I'm curious how these people feel about the polio vaccine, or vaccines for measles/rubella.
1/1	In Hungary i got the Dutch Jansen,and i was never sick since then.
1/-1	In Ontario, we have three major brands: Pfizer, Moderna and Astrazenica. In the past five weeks, I have been keeping track of the new cases each day between the fully vaccinated against the unvaccinated. There now over 10million people age 12+ who are fully vaccinated and about just over 2 million unvaccinated. The resulting efficacy of the vaccines are about 93%.
1/-1	In Tennesee, 97% of covid hospitalizations and 98% of covid deaths are unvaccinated.
0/0	In a few yrs, I really want to make sure what i put in me or my family isnt going to negatively effect them. I won't get it for my chn until a lot later, my point of view is ive lived my life but no way would I ever put a vaccine in their bodies that could possibly cause any harm to them. We've got a long way to go before we know any long term effects

1/-1	In a way the pandemic contributed to the advancement of vaccines.
1/1	In a way, the pandemic contributed to the advancement of vaccines.

1/1	In about an hour and a half I go to get my second shot of the Pfizer vaccine. I’m looking forward to it. No extra incentive needed
0/0	In addition to changing the way we handle vaccine injuries, we need to change the way vaccine roll-outs are handled. They should NEVER have been mandated for ANYONE, or recommended for anyone under the age of 60.
0/-1	In addition to other concerns, what happens when new mutated strains come along and the current vaccine does not work for those strains
1	In my area of Washington it's less than 40% vaccination. And over 80% of hospitalizations are unvaccinated.

1/1	In my experienced, Best to be vaccinated !
0/0	In my humble opinion, it was too soon to release the vaccines without a long term study. I wanted a long term study until we are required to be vaxxed. I am curious if you have received the vaccines since you are a frontline doctor. What did you do to protect yourself after receiving the shots? Thank you for you informative data and detailed explanation.
0/-1	In my humble opinion, that I think the COVID19 mRNA vaccines were basically a massive placebo. They were designed mostly to get their usage approved for future development & approval, while pretending to have a solution to something with no solution.
1/1	In my own defense I don't know why some people refuse to get vaccinated. Because I think they have that fear mentality that it's going to do something to their bodies or something. But went & got mine & I felt perfectly or should I say ok-ish but I trust the medical department
1/1	In order to achieve our goals and end this global pandemic, we must be vaccinated against COVID-19
0/0	In other words the human being is the Guinea pig!! it's a no from me.
0/0	In other words, he'd probably still be living had he not gotten the vaccination.
1/1	In other, poor countries, people can't afford the shot and are literally dying while waiting to get a shot. This person had a choice to get it FOR FREE and chose not to and encouraged others to not get it. Sorry, but I feel no remorse for the choice he made.
1/1	In the Netherlands is the advice if covid is going up people with diseases on their lungs or hart who are vunerable better take this vaccin as already is proved by research to protect them from getting more health problems.
0/0	In the UK our ex prime minister ( Boris Johnson)+ health minister Chris whitty + madazolam matt Hancock all addressed the nation + told us that the covid vaccine was safe knowing full well that it wasn't + lied to us, which has caused unnecessary deaths + injuries it's murder !!!
1/0	In the last two years I've watched nurses who've never had an opinion about vaccines in their life suddenly go full anti-vaccines. It's insane to me but in almost every case I think it's just because they're politically conservative.
0/0	In the same boat but only got one ..i met my husband and he told me not to take the second one ..i developed eye floaters and where the injection was i got some nerve damage along with chronic fatigue and terrible health anxiety now ..i’m happy i didn’t take the other one but as long as ur awake now don’t take anymore and keep praying that this vaccine does no affect to ur body ! oh and also forgot to mention coffee makes anxiety 10x worse ..caffeine consumption can more than double your blood levels of the stress hormones cortisol and epinephrine and not to mention ..The natural effects of caffeine stimulate a host of sensations, such as your heart beating faster, your body heating up, your breathing rate increasing ..i know this myself as well bcus i was a coffee addict and i switched to decaf or chai and matcha
0/-1	In the words of the great Stephen Hawkings: Rubbish.......
1/1	In this video, we should take the knowledge that vaccines are provided for a reason. Vaccine protect and attack any pathogens in our body. This is how the COVID19 vaccine works.
1/1	Inactivated virus has been used in vaccines for decades. It’s safe.
0/0	Incredible, record time , makes me wonder why this energy couldn't have been done with cancer or diabetes? Sure glad I skipped this experiment. Too many unexplained things happening now in regards to mRNA needles
1/1	Independent analysis has been performed on the Oxford Vaccine data, which means it is now peer reviewed. The analysis confirms the vaccine is safe and effective.
1/-1	India gets third Coronavirus vaccine. #SputnikV gets approval. #Sputnik
0/1	Individual conspiracy beliefs may come from a unitary conspiratorial worldview that believes ‘it is common for shadowy networks of people with malevolent intentions to execute mass hoaxes on the public in near-perfect secrecy.
1/1	Individual rights don't supersede public safety. Get vaccinated and be safe!
0/0	Indoctrination
1/1	Inflammation leads to a lot of secondary issues that we still don't know the full extent of. People who got the vaccine had less severe symptoms in general if they did get COVID, I would guess having less severe COVID would lead to less secondary issues (long COVID, etc.).
1/-1	Information from TikTok is not a replacement for scientific research, dipshit.
0/0	Information is coming out fast. Anyone who took two or more vaccines their immune system is being degraded rapidly. The immune system for those who took two or more vaccines are registering at the 20% and continuing to drop lower. That's AIDS territory. Evidence is suggesting the vaccine was a bioweapon.
1/1	Information like this don't sell well in eye catching breaking news media, we're the luckyones, we believe in sciences and facts
1/1	Injecting mRNA into your body will not interact or do anything to the DNA of your cells. mRNA vaccines work by instructing cells in the body how to make a protein that triggers an immune response.
1/1	Inoculating COVID-19 vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others. Believe in science!
1/-1	Instead of fighting each other and pointing fingers, we should all stand together and stand as a human race to end this horrible disease.
1/1	Instead of waiting for your natural immune to kick in, vaccines kicks in and help you develop immunity against various diseases, with vaccination, it's unlikely you will ever catch that disease, instead it prevents epidemics.
0/-1	Interesting how he has to tip toe around the elephant in the room but still manages to convey accurate information. Thank you again!
0/-1	Interesting that they are actually cracking down on this. What happened to that Samantha Svoboda lady that made a tiktok video bragging that she had a forged vaccination card but was still unvaccinated? Did she get arrested?
1/1	Interesting…I’m fully vaxxed & have still yet to get covid. I work at an elementary school so my exposure is huge & yet I’m still covid free….Thank you to doctors & scientists!
0/0	Ireland just suspended the vaccine due to safety concerns regarding blood clotting. Also, why has vaccine companies been given immunity from prosecution if the vaccine is safe?
1/1	Is anybody safe until all are safe ? It is collectively expedient that all are vaccinated !
1/1	Is anyone annoyed at how arrogant the anti-vax community is? They are being told genuine statistics and opinions but they just call them fake, acting like they’re geniuses.
0/-1	Is it just me or am i the only one asking himself Why people listen to a bald woman in a pharmarceutic company?...she clearly is a failed experiment...
1/1	Is it still free? If so, I’ll get it.
1/-1	Is it weird that I did not experience any reactions to the Covid vaccine, but I’m always dying after every single flu shot?!?
0/0/0/0	Is it wise for those with a perfectly healthy immune system to get an experimental shot? A shot from a company with no liability to you should anything go wrong?
1/1	Is not taking it safer? That’s what everyone should ask. Also, the 2009 flu vaccine only took a few months to develop, everyone was fine
0/0	Is there a way to clean out bodies from vaccines?? I got all the horrible symptoms too! Dissociation and blank mind the worst! Can we reverse all that?? Im sure theres a way
0/1	Is there any long term effects of the vaccine??? Or do they even know IF there is any considering this virus has only been studied less than a year?? I’m no anti-vaxxer, in fact I’m quite the opposite, but I’d like to know of all possible risks, if there is any, before taking this vaccine. Hope you guys could respond cause I’m trying to figure this out for myself and I’m having a really hard time doing so. Love the videos btw guys!!!! Love from Ireland!!🇮🇪🤗
1/1	Is there more info on the 26 that did die? I realize it’s an absurdly small percentage—I can read the graph. But I’m wondering if anyone’s drilling into the numbers of fully vaccinated folks that still die…are there any data points? All older? All comorbidities? All over the map? Just curious if there’s info? (Signed, happily fully vaccinated guy who’s just curious)
1/-1	Is vaccination really an effective strategy though? I had a booster December last year and I’m on day four of my first Covid infection now and been badly affected. It seems like you’d have to get a booster every 4 to 6 months.
0/0	Israel's data proves the shots make you MORE susceptible
1/1	It absolutely amazes me how abundant anti-vaxxers are in YT comment section. It makes me wonder how many are actually bots.
0/0	It ain't the sting that bothers me it's the dying after the shot of death !
1/1	It allowed me to travel. Otherwise it didn't bother me either way
1/-1	It allows safer international travel??
1/1	It allows us to gather safely again, let me get out of this house
1/1	It also helps protect your baby from severe health outcomes due to COVID-19 before they become eligible for COVID-19 vaccination when they are 6 months old.
0/0	It amazes me how stupid people still are. I can’t believe someone would still take a vaccine after all that has happened and after all the lies have been brought out into the light. It’s wake up time or die you decide!
0/0	It astounds me that the pro-vaxxers dont see how very odd it is the incessant push for EVERYONE to get this shot. Do you not realize how suspicious and out of order that appears?
1/-1	It becomes about not being wrong and they’d rather be dead than wrong.
0/0	It blows my mind how many people actually took the jab. It was so obvious what was going on…
0/-1	It can come out tomorrow. I am waiting six months before I even consider getting it.
1/1	It changed my life. Shame I wasn’t eligible for it earlier. I still occasionally get sick but it’s very rarely and not terrible compared to the weeks and even months I spent sick before the vaccine. So I make sure I get vaccinated every year. I also get the covid vaccines. I’m sorry for those people who have had bad reactions but I’ve just been tired for a day. I’ve never had covid as far as I know.
0/0	It changes your DNA permanently and you will pass it down from generation to generation to generation. It also has shown to have people to have a false positive of HIV because when Bill Gates made the bio weapon to have HIV as its delivery system, it will also show up in Bill Gates vaccination as he makes trillions of dollars each year off of it. It will also cause men and women to become sterile. It will also cause miscarriages. People are dying from the covid-19 vaccination already. People who take this vaccination will have their RNA and DNA changed so much that they will not being a human but be alien like for the rest of their life and there children and their children's children and so on and so forth. These people will be a danger to society for the human race because of the Frankenstein sense of this. Don't take it!
0/0/0	It could have something to do with the LIES a out the vaccine..... Like you can't infect others if you are vaccinated...... Or the myriad of other lies about masks the origin etc.
1/1	It does work.
0/0	It doesn't affect your body if you don't take it
1/1	It doesn't change your DNA. Please, there are so many educational resources available. Just take a short time to introduce yourself to genetics and mrna vaccines.
1/1	It doesn't cost much, so why not get vaccinated?
1/1	It doesn't matter how fit you are. Have the vaccine
1/1	It doesn't stop you from catching covid ,all it does it 1 catching it so bad 2 having more chance of survival 3 ending up in hospital on a breathing machine. If your healthy without any underlying health conditions then it's fine, but those with underlying health conditions you don't know how the vaccine and your body will react to the vaccine you have. Dammed if you do,dammed if you don't. It's a risk society has to take.
0/0	It doesn't work.
0/0	It doesn’t work.. so why get it. common sense people
1/1/1	It dramatically decreases the chances of the disease spreading from one person to another. If the disease stops spreading, it will eventually reduce its infection rates to that of a regular "non-pandemic" disease. Not to mention the fact that getting vaccinated also reduces the risk of severe symptoms developing if you do get infected
1/1	It feels great to do my part in stopping the spread.
0/0	It feels like the vaccine makers where also the creators of the pandemics so how can you believe them?
1/1	It felt good to do my part in the fight against COVID-19.
0/0	It gave me Rheumatoid Arthritis and a heart attack and I was fired. I’m more than upset!
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	It gave me severely heavy menstrual bleeding that still hasn't stopped 17 months later. 17 consecutive months of bleeding all day every day. High doses of progesterone wont even stop it and now I need a hysterectomy. Thanks a lot Pfizer.
1/-1	It gets better
1/1	It goes without saying that you should take it in connection with the flu every year.
0/0	It has been proven that then COVID vaccine never stopped transmission.
0/0	It has nano technology in the syringe 😡
0/0	It hasn't been tested long enough. We don't know what this kind of gene altering vaccine does to the body in the long run. It's a big no for us.
1/1	It helps prevent further outbreaks.
1/1	It helps prevent hospital overcrowding.
1/1	It helps prevent long term complications from covid.
1/1	It honestly was painless. I had no side effects and no pain in the arm. I was moving normally within an hour
0/0	It infuriates me how so many people who criticize or question the industry always begin with, "I'm not an anti-vaxxer." If you know that it's a scam now, why wouldn't you be an anti-vaxxer? I'm proud to say I'm an anti-vaxxer. I don't believe in poisoning people, particularly under false pretenses, but I'm against poisoning humans and animals in general.
0/1	It is a bit late for this warning because a lot of people got really sick already
0	It is a noteworthy effort, but I already see the result: "It was all staged!", cried the prominent anti-vaxxer. "They showed us half-dead people, who I'm sure were already afflicted by other illnesses, and therefore it is a HOAX!!!!", screamed his psycho-colleague, well-know under the Pseudonym I-don't-shave-my-armpits-and-legs, also known as a Mental-Sasquatch-2020.
1/1	It is a risk, but without a Vaccination it is A risk more...
0/0	It is a synthetic material that is not supposed to be in your body. Everyone should have done more research about the vaccine before you let them stick that needle in your arm. But it was about do what we say said the Democrats. When someone dies why is the first question that they ask. Has he had the vaccine.
0/-1	It is a very simple fact that based on what information the World Health Organization and the World's Government have released to the general public in regards to the COVID-19 virus that the vaccines have simply not gone through the standard vigorous testing protocols that vaccines usually get. Every vaccine that we received prior to the current pandemic has gone through years of animal testing before it goes though select human trials before a vaccine is considered safe for the use by the general public. We are yet to discover a majority of the possible side effects that these vaccines can cause, simply because of the lack of testing. Anyone that has chosen to accept the vaccine has chosen to be an unpaid experimental test subject in the human trials for these vaccines, of course even with that I would recommend that anyone who is fit and healthy to have the vaccine. COVID-19 is a variation of the SARS virus which was widespread in 2003-2006 and we did not need to have lockdown's/masks/vaccines etc. then. However due to the incompetence of certain governments there has been a greater panic this time around. Just a quick reminder that no mater how free you believe yourself to be fear has always been an effective method used by governments to control the population.
1/-1	It is about a pie chart… your emotions mean nothing
0/0	It is absolutely criminal that employers require this vaccine
1/1	It is absolutely incredible how far we've come in science and medicine. We all owe a great deal of gratitude to the thousands of hard-working scientists and doctors who are helping us end this pandemic. So thankful.
0/0	It is all about population control. COVID-19 virus and vaccines are all about population control. Wars is all about population control..
1/0	It is astonishing to me that the benefit of vaccines is something which some people dispute.
0/0	It is called freedom and it is worth dieing for, at all costs no vaccination !
1/0	It is common now for anti-vaxxers to mix conspiracy theories together such as the unproven claim that the Covid-19 vaccine is a bio weapon and the false suggestion that the vaccine is linked to 5G. This is alongside the frequently used QAnon and Global Reset narratives too.
0/0	It is criminal what has happened… my father in the UK got Guillian Barre syndrome after his first Astra Zeneca shot… literally 3 days after he took the vaccine his symptoms started … almost 2 years later he died of a blood clot… His cause of death were these two conditions… I honestly believe if he has not taken that shot he would be alive today. I am so sorry for all those with similar stories/ injuries.
1/1	It is genuinely scary how many gullible sheep in this comment section seriously believe that rna vaccines are the devil. You people are so easily lead, so willfully blinded by false consensus and misinformation from those that would manipulate you, it’s actually alarming. Do research, listen to scientists, try to be objective. It’s a self fulfilling prophecy: if you don’t believe the evidence because you’ve already decided it’s a lie, of course you’re never going to believe the truth. <br><br>Don’t be fooled.
1/1	It is good, so it's pointless to use facts against the anti vax crowd. It's like trying to reason with a rock.
1/1/1/1/1	It is great that this scientific innovation was awarded the Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine in 2023
1/1	It is interesting because it feels like anyone who got the vaccine was considered forced to get it. I got mine and it was my personal choice to get it.
1/0	It is legal to fire employees if they refuse to get vaccinated.
0/-1/0	It is nobody's damn business what health decisions I make for myself.
0/0	It is not being an anti-vaxxer; it’s called making a sensible educated decision. Vaccines usually take 7 years to develop. I’m not willing to be a guinea pig for pharmaceutical companies.
1/-1	It is not unusual for death to occur after using pharmaceuticals. Two of the leading causes of death in the US are use of pharmaceuticals prescribed and taken according to directions, and use of pharmaceuticals not prescribed or taken according to directions. The issue is not whether using some pharmaceutics leads to death, but whether NOT taking pharmaceuticals would lead to more deaths than using them.
0/0/0	It is not vaccine,its bioweapon
0/0/0	It is not vaccine..... it is PATHOGEN
0/0	It is poison and it will be banned.
1/-1	It is simply crazy to think our body is structured like a military defense system and how adaptive immune system can adapt to defend against foreign particles. I also, learned how there's diverse types of vaccines and not just one type. It is amazing to think people made these kinds of defenses for our body.
1/1	It is so very important to help people understand the dangers of the diseases that we are fortunate to be able to fend off or mitigate. To rebuild the bubbles of protection for those unable to protect themselves.
1/1	It is truly unbelievable the lack of respect people have for academia and science. Surely one of life's biggest contradictions!
1/1	It is widely recommended to get the vaccine even if you have contracted and recovered from COVID-19. This is still being studied, but early evidence suggests immunity from COVID-19 may not last very long.
0	It isnt safe and they know it but still push it putting money before health. People are dying around the world after having this untested ' cocktail and they are covering it up by not reporting the truth ! Just carrying on lying to the public its disgusting..
0/0	It isn’t safe. I can tell you that by just looking at the data they’ve collected. They have made it in less than a year. No data for long term testing, and several of them are a brand new technology. New tech, with no long term testing is a death sentence
0/0	It killed my sister
0/0	It literally a common cold only the super young the elderly and those with compromised immune systems were affected. Covid was such a scam
1/1/1	It looking like the vaccine is good taking care of the variants with this study
0/0	It looks like the CDC is going with the old saying " If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit."
0	It made me do some homework on the topic making me not trust ANY vaccines used these days or the companys making them. Pfizer alone has been sued by the federal government almost a 100 times for lying to sell drugs,and even rebranding banned drugs so they could sell more of them.
0/0	It made me horribly sick and then we still got Covid anyway so I don’t think I will be doing it this time.
1/1	It makes covid go from terrifying to mild annoying
1/1	It makes me so angry that in 21st century people STILL wont vaccinate their kids.
1/1	It may have some side effects- pain at site, feeling like your getting sick with fever but that should only last a day or two. The recorded severe allergic reactions has prompted increased measures to deal with allergic reactions. It's better to get the vaccine and ensure your visit to your mom dad or grandparents doesn't kill them.
1/1	It protects you from being seriously sick or dying. It gives overtired overwhelmed doctors and nurses a break. You don’t make any sense! It is 95%. Non- vaccinated that are filling up the hospitals. If you work in healthcare you should know better.
1/1	It reduces the severity of illness, thank god both my grandparents got the vaccine.
0/0	It screams cover-up when we aren't "allowed" to talk about a potential health crisis.
1/1	It seems SO obvious: protect yourself, protect your family, protect your friends…protect strangers. “Get busy living or get busy dying.” [“The Shawshank Redemption” 1994]
0/0/0	It seems ever since I got the vax, I've been struggling consistently with allergies.
1/1	It should absolutely be mandatory.
0/0	It should alarm you that we are headed toward a society where you will need to offer up unlimited access to your veins in exchange for permission to live a normal life.

1/1	It took us a good 2 years to make a vaccine and now the cases are slowing down. I hope everyone is doing just great in the pandemic. Like 39 Dislike Reply
1	It triggered my allergy and diabetes slightly.but gave more tolerance to flu and fever.
1/1	It uttely astonishes me that there are groups of people in this day and age who don't believe in vaccines! Had a very heated discussion with an anti-vacciner who simply was bent on proving to me that he was immune to covid-19 🤯
0/0	It was NOT a vaccine. Confirmed by highly respected experts on the matter....and it was EXPERIMENTAL. Even the European Agency in charge of medical products listed it as such....and people went for it in a social experiment of manipulation and intimidation. We should all review our attitudes and personal defense mechanisms against this type of situation. Hope it doesn't happen again. And condolences to the families of those who died and those who suffer the consequences.
0/0	It was a scam. Wake up. They'll do it again because of how many fell for it.

0/0/0/0	It was bad for everybody and in my opinion it was deliberate
0/0	It was bad for everyone no matter what age this has become clear.
1/1	It was chilling to hear the physician talking about his patients with covid. This should be enough to jolt antivaxxers out from their delirium.
0/0	It was created so quick not FDA approved yet and they were injecting already and it did nothing for me to help with being sick.
0/0	It was in the first year that the highest “vaccination “rate and the highest covid death rate was on the news regarding an island resort Western Europe.
1/1	It was my choice to get vaccinated. And I’m just fine.
0/0/0	It was not a mistake. It was done on purpose. They knew about the adverse reactions, and what they had to gain by selling an injection while immune to liability.
0/0	It was not a vaccine look up the definition I just remember they changed the definition!!! Fk you all you was all for it good on those of us who refused or you’d all be in the shit by now. it’s a medical intervention .
0/0	It was not acceptable to give the vaccine to people who were at no risk of dying from covid It was not acceptable to mandate the vaccine People weren't able to give informed consent as they weren't told their individual risk v benefit
0/0	It was pretty clear to me that something whipped up in 6 months wasn't going in my body and if you got the shot it's on you.
0/0/0/0/0	It was rushed and not tested properly.
0/0	It was rushed to the market and there have been reported adverse effects from it. And, it’s too early to determine what the long-term effects are. I trust this just about as much as I trust our corrupt government right now.
0/0	It wasn’t safe for Lisa Shaw and many more like her. It’s either safe for everyone or it’s not. Conclusion: not safe. You can’t say every death matters when it comes to covid and then put vaccine deaths down as collateral damage.
1/1	It will definitely have side affects however not adverse, which is very encouraging. Thumbs up for everyone involved
0/0	It will mess up our DNA
0/0	It will surely end us all
0/0	It would even be funnier if this comment section was disabled. But yea if you took that poison i have bad news for you…
1/1	It would seem ideal if everyone tried to stick to the data. Current covid19 vaccines are excellent at reducing morbidity/mortality upon infection, they reduce transmission to an extent, and have limited side-effects. Their benefit is maximal to those most at risk to covid19.
1/1	It's 100% safe! Trust me I'm a NHS Doctor!
0/0	It's a fake vaccine and why wasn't the nurse wearing gloves and now they can track where ever she goes
0/0	It's a heartwarming experience to read through the comments and see how many people realize this is pure, unadulterated bullshit promoted by known liars.

1/1	It's a scary thing for me to know that even a pediatrician can be an anti-vax person.....
1/1	It's a vaccine. Stop making mountains out of molehills. If you don't want to take the vaccine, don't. Stop parroting stupid conspiracy theories. Innocent people die because of listening to them. The covid-19 vaccine help your body to fight the virus so it won't kill you. The virus killed a lot of people before the vaccine was developed..We should be thankful the Doctors and scientists was able to come with a vaccine to fight covid-19. People do your research before speak against the the covid-19 vaccine. I taken it. When I was in grade school and high school I had to be vaccinated. I'm still alive. The covid-19 vaccine changing your DNA is idiotic , Mike tyson favorite saying it ludicrous.

1/-1	It's amazing what people can do with virtually unlimited funding and resources
1/1	It's amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It's a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
1/1	It's an absolute no brainer to get the vaccinations to prevent hospitalization, suffering and death from Covid-19.

0/-1	It's beautiful how people can create vaccines yet creepy because we could say the same thing for creating viruses or diseases.
1/1	It's been over a year now I wonder how different are people's opinion of it now? success or not? For me personally I think the vaccine is a success. Maybe next year I'll change my mind but one thing is for sure if you didn't get it you don't have to worry about next year.
0/0	It's been two years already. If vaccines really worked, this would have ended by now.
0/0	It's bs my kid who's fully vaccinated got it from school and brought it joke to 11 of us fully vaccinated and we are all very sick
0/0	It's called the "clot shot" for a reason Never got it, never will
1/1	It's comforting to know that there are so many really smart people out there working to solve hard problems like this.
0/0	It's common for clinical medicine to be about 20 years behind prevailing science. Clinicians have little time (and minimal desire) to stay on top of research and are often guided by pharmaceutical companies and/or outdated National Health guidelines. I work as a medical researcher hired by a cooperative of functional medical clinicians to keep them on top of the latest diagnostics, treatment options, nutrition science, and anything else relevant. It's my job to read the science and report relevant info and data. Our collective advised against the vaccine because the team was unconvinced by the available research. All patients in the practice have had Covid infection, with zero deaths, and one patient with lupus appears to have exacerbated symptoms, so classed as a long Covid patient. It's kind of a sad reality that medicine and science aren't as married as we assume.
1/1	It's crazy , we have the same freedom here and value them as well , but we are 92% Vax in our community 🤔 biggest difference I think here it's doctors who pass on the information and not the Media or government and if someone from the Government is on TV it's always with a doctor, but it's not the same on other parts of canada , but I'm nova scotia it's total is 76%
1/0	It's crazy that arguably the two countries that have performed worst during the entire Pandemic have somehow managed to absolutely nail the vaccination rollout. From the UK perspective its is all down to the NHS and the thousands of volunteers.
1/1	It's disheartening to see misinformation spreading about vaccines. The science is clear: vaccines are safe and effective. Let's trust the experts and protect our communities.

Yes, it should be taken off the market because it's unsafe but our government is corrupt like you have no idea, people need to realize that. The good news is, there's incredible potential with this new administration coming in to hopefully expose all the lies and deceit from those currently in power.
1/1	It's hard to win an argument against a smart person, but it's impossible to win an argument against someone as ignorant as these anti-vaccinators
0/0/0	It's harming people!!!
1/1	It's important for individuals to make informed decisions about vaccination based on reliable scientific evidence and guidance from healthcare professionals. Vaccination not only protects individuals but also contributes to herd immunity, reducing the overall spread of infectious diseases within communities.
1/1	It's important to get vaccinated to stop the spread.
1/1	It's incredible how well the vaccine works at reducing severity.
1/1	It's insanity to think we will ever eradicate COVID without people being vaccinated. New variants will continue to multiply requiring newer vaccines. Round and round we go until none of us are safe. It's infuriating.

1/0	It's not harmful to get it right after you've had COVID, but it will be less effective. Much better to wait 3 months so your immune system has time to reset. Also, right now you still have protection from your July infection, so you don't need the vaccination yet.

0/0	It's value is shit. The COVID vaccine is the only vaccine I've ever had that I contracted the illness after having been vaccinated. I got COVID 2 months after I was vaccinated and the symptoms were identical to when I got COVID before being vaccinated.

1	Its basically cuz insurance companies and general cdc incompetence/skullduggery have made everyone think that covid vaccines should happen once per year despite every single source saying that protection from infection wanes within a few months. Last vaccines came out in the fall, leaving everyone vulnerable 9 months later (that is among those who even took the updated vaccine)

0/0	It’s also true though that if you’re young and healthy there really is no need to take it so don’t force it. It never stopped transmission and vaccine passports and six feet apart is not based in science.
1/1	It’s always better to be safe than sorry. Get the new booster folks, before you travel for the holidays
1/1	It’s amazing how many people have been completely brain washed by anti vaccination misinformation spreading online. I’ve gone through dozens of comments and been able to debunk every single one of them and yet, there’s no stopping it. My conclusion is that we have a severe problem with our system of education.
1/1	It’s amazing how simple and quick the vaccination process was. I got my shot, and after a few minutes, I was on my way. The staff were incredibly helpful and answered all my questions. I’m so happy to now be vaccinated and feel a lot more confident about going about my daily activities. It’s a small thing to do, but it’s such a huge step toward ending the pandemic and returning to normal life.
1/1	It’s amazing how vaccines help our bodies build immunity without us having to suffer through the actual disease. Science is incredible!
1/1	It’s amazing how vaccines turned COVID from a deadly pandemic into something manageable. We owe it to medical science.
1/1/1/1	It’s amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It’s a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
1/1	It’s an important tool against the pandemic.
1/1	It’s basically sugar water, dead virus, and stem cells. Get vaccinated. There’s no excuse at this point!!
1/1	It’s been authorized for emergency use or pending as of the time of posting this comment. While other nations have approved it like in the UK
1/1	It’s better than being hospitalized or getting severe symptoms.
1/1	It’s better to have the vaccine and not need it than to get Covid and then need the vaccine.
1/1	It’s clear that getting vaccinated will protect people from hospitalization and death. Even if there’s a breakthrough infection, that will only result in mild to moderate symptoms or no symptoms at all.
0/-1	It’s completely Stalinist to believe it isn’t
0/0	It’s crazy how different this conversation would be if it took place today. Opening the nurse says the vaccine prevents infection which we now know is absolutely false hahaha
1/1	It’s crazy how people trust doctors for surgeries, prescriptions, and treatments but suddenly think they know better when it comes to vaccines
1/1	It’s crazy how people trust random Facebook posts over medical professionals.
1/1	It’s disconcerting to see that willful ignorance towards medical science isn’t exclusive to here in the USA. Antivaxxers are the same people who would have chosen death from small pox because they “don’t know what might be in that needle”.
1/1	It’s easy to think it’s all happening too fast, but years of vaccine research made this possible—it’s not as sudden as it seems.
1/1	It’s exhausting seeing people fight against something that could literally save their lives
1/1	It’s frustrating to see people refuse the vaccine when it’s clear they’re putting themselves and others at risk. Selfishness won’t help us beat a global pandemic.
1/-1	It’s funny how people will take unregulated supplements but fear FDA-approved vaccines. 🤦♂️
0/0	It’s funny how they downplay side effects while pushing this thing like our lives depend on it.
1/1	It’s great that vaccines were released!
1/1	It’s great to see science in action, this is the way
1/1	It’s great to see so many people getting vaccinated!
1/1	It’s important to have these discussions based on evidence. Data from the CDC and other health organizations show that unvaccinated individuals are at a higher risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 compared to those who are vaccinated. For example, unvaccinated people were found to be 14 times more likely to die from COVID-related complications than fully vaccinated individuals. Vaccines have been shown to reduce the severity of illness and the burden on healthcare systems.
1/1	It’s incredible how decades of research behind mRNA technology made this vaccine possible so quickly.
1/1	It’s incredible how fast science advanced to give us a solution.All you do is have a positive mindset.
1/1	It’s inspiring to see so many people coming together to get vaccinated.
0/0	It’s just a way to keep us dependent on Big Pharma.
0/0	It’s just messes with your natural health…simple.
1/1	It’s like wearing a seatbelt in case you get in a car accident. The seatbelt doesn’t stop a car accident, but if you get into one, the damage to your body is much less severe.
1/1	It’s like “Hey I know it’s your job to be a Doctor and you’ve received an education, but I drink kombucha and read Reddit posts so I’m obviously much more knowledgeable than you”
0/0	It’s likely the MRNA moving around your body. Unfortunately it doesn’t stay in your arm, it spreads throughout your body and attaches itself to your organs and so on. The hospital won’t help you or the doctors.. you’ll be met with ridicule unfortunately. If you look for help online you’ll have all kinds of different opinions you’d write off as hocus pocus. Pray for yourself and for goodness sake stop getting the shots!
0/0	It’s my biggest regret!!! I was healthy, after vaccinations I am not… and still not after 3 years. I will never take any vaccines!
0/-1	It’s my body, and I decide what goes into it.
0/0	It’s my body, my choice. That includes rejecting the vaccine.
0/0	It’s my choice, and I choose no.
0/0/0	It’s my understanding; -the vaccine is no longer 95% affective. -people who’ve been vaccinated can still be infected and can still be spreaders.
0/0	It’s never about your health. It’s about controlling you with anything.
1/1	It’s nice not dying from polio
0/0	It’s not a conspiracy if it’s actually happening, vaccines are killing.
1/1	It’s not about personal choice when that choice affects everyone around you.
0/1	It’s not about you. It’s about the other people you could infect if you get sick
0/0	It’s not an approved drug. It’s a trial as there’s no data.
1/1	It’s not just about personal choice; it’s about public health.
0/0	It’s not just the immediate effect it’s the long term effect
1/1	It’s not rocket science—vaccines work, misinformation doesn’t.
0/0	It’s not the new Covid vaccine. It’s the previous Covid vaccines. They didn’t prevent you from getting Covid and gave you a bunch of terrible side effects, including death. Those shots were not for your health
1/1	It’s not the vaccines…more like the crap in our water and air that is making kids and adults sick
0/0	It’s not worth risking taking it. It’s worse than coronavirus itself.
1/1	It’s okay to have questions, but refusing the vaccine without understanding it seemed like a bigger gamble to me.
1/1	It’s okay to question things, but at some point, we have to rely on experts who know far more than we do.
0/0	It’s only rare when it doesn’t happen to you.
0/0	It’s poison and the people responsible should be arrested
0	It’s poison ☠️
1/1	It’s reassuring to know that the vaccine has undergone rigorous testing. I feel safe taking it.
0/0	It’s ruined a lot of lives including mine. Sick and tired of the “pro media” it’s safe blah blah. I know literally dozens of people permanently affected by it and that’s in my close circle of friends.
1/1	It’s sad and sometimes makes me angry that in a country like the US has such polarising views on vaccines because it’s soooo available to everyone there. I’m in South East Asia where vaccines are so hard to get and we’ve been in a constant lockdown for many many months. People here can’t even get it easily even if they beg for it.
1/1	It’s sad how some people care more about their own conspiracy theories than the actual lives lost to this virus—vaccines are about saving humanity, not controlling it.
0/0	It’s simple. The same people pushing that junk on us are the same people who’ve been pushing all the vaccines on us. They’ve lost my trust.
1/1	It’s smart to get. It wears off in a percentage of the population.
1/1	It’s so sad bc they still have to care for them even if they still don’t want the COVID vaccine. she’s sitting there taking up resources and on a machine to help her breath and she still won’t get it ?…
0/0	It’s subtlety interesting how they use the word “harmless” to describe the spike protein & the carrier virus. 🤔😒😒😒
1/1	It’s such a small action that has such a big impact.
1/1	It’s that time of year again! Got my flu shot and C0VID booster. It only takes a few minutes and the upsides are huge, not just for yourself, but for the people you care about
1/1	It’s that time of year everyone! New Covid vaccine just dropped! Please think about your immunocompromised family, friends, and neighbors.
0/-1	It’s the flu shot, they all know better not to get the actual Covid vaccine
0/0	It’s true right after I got vaccinated with Covid vaccine I got cancer
1/1	It’s true, i got moderna. I was only sick for a day when I got COVID acting two months after my second shot. I’ve had colds that were way worse. Almost like I just slept it off. Lost my sense of taste and smell for only half a day. That was the only indication that I had that it was COVID. Otherwise i would’ve thought it was just strep.
1/1	It’s up to you to decide if you are okay with infecting others—some of whom may die, including me. It’s called responsibility. Please be responsible.
0/0/-1	It’s very very likely that it’s safe... BUT I am healthy, young and don’t need it. So I won’t run the risk, slim as it probably is. There’s no long term study of this thing, so you never know...
0/0	It’s weird how there is no vaccine for the “common cold” or “flu”, then boom all the sudden in important election year the establishment rolls out the China Virus Fear Campaign and a magical cure.
1/-1	It’s wild how people trust medicine when they’re sick but doubt it when it prevents sickness in the first place.
1/-1/1	It’s worth highlighting that the vast majority of Covid studies were done with folks who had no immunity of any sort during the first wave, and or during the delta wave. It seems like negative outcomes are lower (unclear how much lower) for people with preexisting immunity (vaccine and/or prior infection) and later Covid variants.
0/0/0	Ive been in healthcare 13 years, and even after hearing horror stories, I would never ever, ever, trust them to take that vaccine. I never once thought about it, and it was never a question, whether I would take it or not. I was forced out of my 13 year career and healthcare in California due to these insane mandates. The science was not on their side, everything they taught me in healthcare for the last 13 years went out the window. More than 60 of healthcare. Workers refused taking the vaccines and then they were slowly forced to do so one by one.I will never forget what I went through, and I will never ever forgive this administration.
1/-1	Ive been vaccinated my husband dad ,not one of us gree horns had MRI, CT scans no stroke heart attacks or anything .<br>Get educated people,this embarrassing all of the self professed doctors who are googling and parroting stories .( Thank. You doctor Mike)

1/-1	I’ll absolutely 100% get the vaccine… but I’m hoping the option for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is available to me by the time it’s my turn. Knowing what I know about human beings — about human beings under capitalism especially — I can easily see something going wrong with the refrigeration required for the Pfizer vaccine or for the Moderna vaccine… and for that problem to then be simply covered up by someone either afraid of losing their job or unwilling to throw out pallets of expensive vaccine. Being from Latin America I can tell you where I grew up especially MANY people ignored protocol ALL THE TIME if it’d save them a few seconds or make them a few extra cents and equipment was routinely under-maintained people were regularly under-trained and top officials were often under-qualified for whatever position their uncle in the navy had scored them… so recalling my upbringing if a vaccine requires refrigeration I can easily see it having reached room temperature a dozen times with all the dry ice sold off and half the real vaccine replaced with corn syrup and rerouted to a private black market by the time a pallet of it ever reaches Chacaito in Caracas Venezuela. I’m sorry to be cynical and such problems may be less pronounced across Europe or North America… but I’d rather have the vaccine that can be stored at room temperature. I’d be too nervous of getting bunk otherwise. I’m all for vaccination mind you! And hooray to the W.H.O. for having wholly eliminated smallpox! I just worry about the logistics of distributing a product worldwide across many stages and through many hands when it requires such low and uninterrupted refrigeration… and the room-temperature Oxford vaccine raises no such concerns from me.

0/0	I’m a PROUD anti-vaxxer of all vaccines after researching them for 10 years.
1/1/1	I’m a biomedical scientist and have been thoroughly researching scientific and clinical literature for C19 early treatment options online. Vaccination is essential but it does not exclude any of the risks associated with Covid 19. Prior to vaccination, anywhere in the world Ivermectin has been introduced on a wide-scale use as prevention and early treatment , there has been up to 97% decline in Covid 19 cases, hospitalisation and death in the first 3-5 weeks. E.g. Zimbabwe, Czechia, Slovakia, Macedonia, Poland, parts of South Africa and recently Dehli, Uttar Pradesh, Goa and a few other Indian states. This is not surprising. In the last 50 years, apart from being anti-parasitic, Ivermectin has been shown, in vitro and in vivo, to be a potent antiviral (including mRNA viruses,) an immune-modulator and an anti-inflammatory. It’s been shown to have over 20 mechanisms of actions. This is the only medication which has been shown to work at all 4 stages of C19. The earlier, the better. Research the dosages, information, literature references and outpatient protocol on FLCCC site.
1/1	I’m a college student so you BET I’m getting that vaccine when it becomes available
1/1/1/1	I’m a doctor, and I get all the new COVID vaccines
1/1	I’m a fan of vaccines. My father almost died of polio because he was born before a vaccine. Millions of people died of smallpox before vaccines. Millions of people died of tetanus before vaccines. I’m fond of living so I’ll keep my vaccines current
1/1	I’m a fellow BLACK RESPIRATORY THERAPIST, i recommend the vaccine. Although you may still catch the virus, your symptoms may not be as severe as someone who is unvaccinated.
1/1	I’m a paramedic with asthma so yes
1/1	I’m a public school teacher, I am 100% going to be taking a vaccine as soon as possible to make sure I don’t spread anything unintentionally to my students or colleagues. When we have the tools to stop suffering, we need to use them.
0/0	I’m a smoker. Not a 2 pack a day smoker, but a smoker. I had a few nurse friends tell me that they had seen hardly any smokers during COVID, and it was believed that the nicotine was protecting their lungs. I didn’t get the vaccine, nor have I had COVID. I’m 68.

1/1	I’m also pro vaccine and acknowledge Covid is real, I wore masks which I found to be helpful. I also don’t like Trump or any far right political parties in my country.
0/0	I’m amazed anyone is still asking themselves this question given we know that they don’t work as stated and the risk of adverse reaction is much greater from the vaccine than the virus!!
1/-1	I’m an ER doctor - the amount of people that have refused the vaccine but are 100% on board with getting experimental plasma/antibody treatment once they test positive are astounding
1/1	I’m as pro vax as it gets. The drum beat on this vaccine harms trust in the standard vaccine schedule. People see they’ve been lied to about its effectiveness and necessity when it comes to kids. That damaged trust will impact uptake of necessary childhood vaccines like MMR, etc.

1/1	I’m curious, now that I’ve been vaccinated since back in February at this point and going into public pretty much everyday since…..I wonder how many times I’ve been exposed to covid. Like how many times I would’ve been infected in a pre-vaccine scenario.
0/0/0/-1	I’m dealing with my first bout now; tested positive about 30 hours ago. Started with feeling cold which seemed normal since the evening was unusually cold outside but within a few hours I recognized it was fever chills. A few hours later, the fever spiked to just over 105 but dropped a few hours later, ranging between 101 and 103.5 every time I check. Have had occasional muscle aches but what’s killing me is the headache. It’s hard to walk easily, it’s been hard to look at screens, and it’s hard to sleep. The experience is very similar to the side effects I had from the JnJ vaccine: 3 solid days of fever, chills, aches, and this awful headache not like any other headache I’m prone to (migraine, tension, eye strain). Congestion is mild to moderate, not that bad. In the past few hours the headache has eased a little and the fever is averaging lower so hopefully I can do some work from home. It’s hard to focus though, and my work tends to be complicated 😵💫 I don’t know how I got it; I’m a homebody who mostly just goes to work where nobody Ive gotten close to is sick, and errands where I keep my distance from others. A friend I visited over the weekend isn’t sick, we just chatted outside. It seems that the current variants are highly contagious, perhaps more than current guidelines for distance and time for transmission suggest.
1/1	I’m definitely getting a covid vaccine. I’m not gonna be a coward and refuse such a scientific remedy

1/1	I’m happy to take the vaccine. It’s our best chance at returning to a normal world.
1/1	I’m happy with my decision to get the COVID vaccine. Not only am I protecting myself, but I’m trying to protect my mom too. I also work in the school system, and the thought of being a carrier or passing on the virus to someone more vulnerable is unthinkable to me. Even though I didn’t enjoy the side effects, like someone above said, I won’t die from the vaccine, but I could from COVID.
1/1	I’m here in Israel, and it’s actually hilarious how easy it is to get the vaccine. I got a text from my healthcare provider and was at the vaccination center 20 minutes later. Took five minutes to get vaccinated and then waited 15 minutes on-site to watch out for complication. Second vaccine is on Wednesday!
1/1	I’m immune compromised so I get a Covid vaccine
1/1	I’m in Australia and the same for us. We live in a reginal area and we have to wait months to get a vaccine the city has as much as it wants but here in the country we have to wait. It’s wrong
0/0	I’m in good health anyway. Even if I catch COVID, I’ll get through it. Why bother with the shot?
1/1	I’m in the Pfizer trial and got it in September! No side effects other than a sore arm. My kids (20 and 23 years old) got the moderna one and were achy with chills for less than 24 hours. So yes, 10/10 would recommend.
0/0	I’m in the baby industry. I lost count of friends having stillbirths and miscarriages. It’s still on going. Pre 2020, I knew of one friend, 1 friend whom had a stillbirth… after rollout… I’ve lost count…. So evil. We need justice.
1/1	I’m just glad we have a vaccine!
0/0	I’m just tired of everyone pushing the vaccine like it’s the only solution. What about natural immunity? Doesn’t that count for anything?
1/1	I’m late to your post but both of my children had the Covid vaccine and they’re happy babies! I got them when we traveled out of state.
1/1	I’m looking forward to getting it. It’s been a year since my last booster, so I’m due, and I’d like the updated formulation. I had to bail on my appointment because of an unrelated infection a few weeks ago, and I’m almost back to 100% and ready to go!
1	I’m medically trained and I’ve done my research and have seen the effects of both ideas. If vaccines did not exist you would not be living with the sense of safety and security from infectious disease
0/0	I’m never getting another covid vax. Ever.
0/0	I’m never getting it
1/1	I’m no doctor, but I’ll bet the percentages of the side effect called death from not taking the shot, is more. Personally, I’ll listen to my doctors over Republican politicians any day of the week on healthcare.
0/-1	I’m not a anti vaccine guy but this is almost scaremongering
1/1	I’m not against them.
1/-1	I’m not against vaccines but I’m not comfortable with these vaccines that are made in less then a year and have no long term testing. There is nothing wrong with being hesitant, once you put it in, you can’t take it out.
0/0	I’m not against vaccines, just this one.
0/-1	I’m not against vaccines, just this vaccine. This vaccine is being pushed for reasons they don’t want us to know!
0/-1	I’m not an anti-vaxxer, but this one doesn’t sit right with me.
0/0	I’m not an anti-vaxxer, just cautious.
1/1	I’m not an antivaxxer myself, but I do feel that the COVID vaccines are marginal at best. I personally got the J&J vaccine as soon as it was available and eventually got double boosted with Moderna.
0/0	I’m not anti-vaccine, but I am anti-this vaccine. I don’t trust it.
0/0	I’m not anti-vax but we did not give our baby the COVID vaccine. For US personally we do not feel there is enough information about it to give to her.
0/0	I’m not anti-vax or anything, but I’m just not comfortable with how fast they rolled this out. Feels kinda rushed, you know?
0/0/0	I’m not anti-vax, but this one just doesn’t seem safe.
0/0	I’m not comfortable taking a new mRNA vaccine.
0/0	I’m not convinced by the research.

0/1	I’m not even anti-vax but honestly I’d be worried about taking a vaccine
1/-1	I’m not getting it, most the people I know on both sides of politics haven’t and aren’t getting it
0/1	I’m not getting the vaccine until they can prove it’s 100% safe. I don’t want to be a guinea pig.
0	I’m not getting vaccinated because I believe it’s part of a greater agenda to control the population.
0/0	I’m not gonna change my mind just because the government said covid vaccines are safe!
1/1	I’m not religious and I am pro-vax and even pro-vax mandates but I do believe that people with legitimate religious reasons should be exempt and not penalized for it.
1/-1	I’m not saying the vaccine didn’t accomplish its goals. I’m saying that Moderna and Pfizer claimed it would be way way longer lasting than it was. It is what it is, but I roll my eyes at these billionaire companies who give up on R&D after taking in billions for vaccines that were great but not nearly as effective as their CEOs were claiming they’d be.
0/-1	I’m not scared of it. I don’t need long term studies. The answer is simply no.
0/0	I’m not sure the vaccine will prevent further mutations of the virus. It feels like a temporary solution.
0	I’m not taking something where the pharmaceutical companies have ZERO liability if something goes wrong
0/0	I’m not taking that bs
1/-1	I’m ok with vaccines. I am not ok with track and trace though
0/0	I’m one of the lucky ones who had a reaction and will not be taking the second vaccine. I broke out in severe hives all over my body, my arms, face and feet swelled up and I ended up in the ER. EVERY doctor said it wasn’t the vaccine but after getting checked by my allergy specialist she thinks it was vaccine related but still recommends taking the second dose 🤦🏻♀️. No thanks I don’t wanna have to go through that again. To willingly go into Anaphylaxis, take an epi shot, steroids, tons of meds would be crazy.

1/1	I’m proud to have done my part in ending this pandemic by getting vaccinated. It’s a small step with a big impact.
0/0	I’m proudly unvaccinated. The video right before this one was about all the vaccine injuries.. These people should loose their licenses.
1/1/1	I’m real big pro vaccine. Mainly because they’ve been proven to work overall. But I’m happy we have grifters like this. Republicans can slowly continue to die off from lack of vaccines. Natural selection at play. I fuck with it.
1/1	I’m really glad I got vaccinated. The shot was quick, the side effects were minimal, and now I feel way more protected against COVID.
1/1	I’m relieved I got vaccinated. The process was so quick, and the staff were incredibly kind and patient. I felt informed and cared for throughout. Now I can go about my day-to-day life with more confidence and peace of mind.
0/0	I’m shocked at how many stupid people would allow a government who injected syphilis into African American arms (tuskegee experiment) then inject them with a “vaccine” technology that has never been tested for long term side effects.

0/0	I’m so upset I got the 1st shot. My mom didn’t know better. My dr pushed and pushed after we said no previous appts.Now I have PCOS, POTS, EDS, & more
0/0	I’m sorry did you see that facebook post my uncle shared about his friend’s friend who randomly died 18 months after getting the vaccine in a car accident at the age of 83? Obviously these vaccines are not safe.
1/1	I’m sorry, but this just makes vaccines sound more metal
1/1	I’m still getting the COVID vaccines every year with my flu shot. I’m morbidly obese, borderline diabetic, and asthmatic. I’m a divorced, widowed, single mother of two kids. I have to do everything I can to live, and be functional! 😮💨
1/1	I’m still having lingering waves of brain and exhaustion symptoms from having it earlier this month. I’m def getting the next vaccine as soon as I can.
0/0	I’m still not able to set foot on my employer grounds in Australia due to employers vaccines mandates, they must think I will give everyone Covid that I have never had! Unvaccinated and proud of not trusting there lies
0/-1	I’m still observing, not sure if the vaccine is completely useless against new variants.
0/1	I’m still shocked at my coworkers reasoning for not getting the vaccine when it was offered to her: “my husbands a conspiracy theorist so we’ve decided not to take it”
0/-1	I’m super worried ab it too I almost didn’t get it at all but then I fucking turned and got 2 shots now I’m worried I might die
1/1	I’m supporting the vaccine to protect those who are vulnerable and ensure we can end this pandemic.
0/-1	I’m sure the 4th dose will fix everything. If not, then definitely the 5th and 6th doses. If the 7th dose isn’t enough, we should consider weekly booster shots.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I’m sure there are a multitude of side effects that we still aren’t aware of.
1/1	I’m taking it. In fact, I was on the Moderna trial (but I am pretty sure I got the placebo). I’ll take the vaccine as soon as I can.
1/1	I’m team please-don’t-cancel-my-appointment-please-just-let-me-get-vaccinated

1/1	I’m thankful for the peace of mind the vaccine provides.
1/1	I’m thankful for vaccines and far from thankful for woefully dangerous misinformation from cult nuts.
1/1	I’m the only one in my office who got the latest booster. I’m also the only one in my office who has not had Covid even after being exposed to it.
1/1	I’m thinking nothing, no story, no science will ever change the mind of those who believe lies about vaccines until they get sick and/or a loved one dies.
0/0	I’m tired of being called stupid for questioning Big Pharma’s motives.
0/0	I’m tired of people shaming those who choose not to get the shot. It’s a personal decision!

1/1	I’m very glad that my parents got me vaccinated.
1/1	I’m very pro vaccine, but it’s hard to trust the medical community who is prescribing puberty blockers to minors and chemically castrating young men. I see why people are skeptical of medical community.

0/0	I’m waiting for more research before making a decision.
1/1	I’m with you. We both have our vaccines for Covid. We did not give that one to our 3 yr old. We had Covid twice and it was very mild. I fully trust vaccines but given this one is quite new I’m willing to take a chance for myself, my family and my community but not for the LO.

1/1	I’ve been interviewing @jabraham and following his career for over a year so now that I’m finally eligible for a vaccine I asked him to do the honors and stab me in the arm...and I think he enjoyed it ? ? thanks, Dr. Jerry! @SpecNews1SoCal #halfvaxxed #moderna https://t.co/UBhadLNLIs
1/1	I’ve been meaning to get vaccinated for a while, and I’m so happy I finally did. The shot was fast and painless, and the people administering it were so friendly and knowledgeable. I’ve had no issues whatsoever, and I feel a great sense of relief knowing that I’m doing my part to prevent the spread of COVID. Plus, I feel much safer going out in public knowing that I’m protected. If you’re on the fence, I highly recommend getting the vaccine.
0/0	I’ve been skeptical of vaccines since I was a kid and had a bad reaction to vaccines. My kids and I are unvaccinated and don’t regret it!

0/0	I’ve got nerve pain in all over my body since jab 9 months of pain and is causing joint disability
1/1	I’ve gotten a booster every 6-8 months. Never had Covid (so far.).
1/1	I’ve gotten all the shots and boosters and have not yet gotten Covid
0/0	I’ve gotten enough info to know that it’s too risky and sus to take it this early
1/1	I’ve gotten them every time they’ve been offered. The benefits outweigh the risks/downsides. I want to reduce my chances of getting hospitalized and developing long COVID.
1/1	I’ve had 4. Never got COVID. I didn’t have side effects. Overall very tangible impact on me.

1/1	I’ve had all the vaccines and can’t remember the last time I’ve been sick, definitely before 2020
1/1	I’ve had all the vaccines. I had Covid once, but was able to manage at home.
0/0	I’ve had bad reactions to vaccines before, not risking it again.
1/1	I’ve had every vaccine as soon as it’s available to me, including the flu and COVID shots. Even when I had both on the same day this year, I barely felt anything. It’s such a small sacrifice compared to the protection it gives me and the people around me. At 78, my immune system isn’t what it used to be, so I take every precaution I can to stay safe, including avoiding crowds. The vaccine is a vital tool in protecting my health and helping prevent the spread to others. I’m fully supportive of vaccination because it’s the responsible thing to do for everyone’s safety.
1/1	I’ve had every vaccine that was ever given! Thank God for scientists!!!
1/1	I’ve had it and will be getting a second dose soon
0/0	I’ve had loads of vaccines in my lifetime. The worst I ever felt, was a slightly unwell feeling for a few hours. Then I had the COVID vaccine….suffering from parathesia for over 2 months. And that’s what I’m aware of….

1/1	I’ve had the vaccine and I had i high temperature and was tiered for one day but after that I was all good
0/0	I’ve heard from countless individuals that regret getting the covid jabs, who stopped getting more. And I've talked to hundreds that have had zero, and not even one regrets their decision. In fact, the vast majority agree that not participating in this is one of the best decisions that we’ve ever made in our lives. All that I need to know, right there
0/0	I’ve heard too many cases of heart problems after the vaccine.
0/0	I’ve heard too many stories about people having serious side effects from the vaccine. It’s just not worth it.

0/0	I’ve read too many conflicting reports about the vaccine to feel comfortable getting it.
1/1	I’ve seen enough evidence to believe the vaccine does far more good than harm.
1/1	I’ve seen enough in my lifetime to know that we should take precautions when we can. I got vaccinated because I want to be around to see my grandkids grow up.
1/1	I’ve seen enough organ donors (ages 20-40) that died of a stroke within 45 days of recovery from mild COVID that my family and I will continue to get our booster shots (that are updated to reflect more recent variants).
1/0/1	I’ve seen too many people suffer from COVID. The vaccine is our way out of this nightmare.
0/0	I’ve seen too many stories of bad reactions. Not worth it.
0/0	I’ve seen too many stories of people having severe reactions to the vaccine. It’s not worth the risk.

1/1/1	I’ve taken shots the last few years ever since we started having boosters available. I’m so grateful for them.
1/1	I’ve taken the vaccine and I’m completely fine. All I felt was muscle pain on my arm for a day or two.
1/1	I’ve thought about this THIS!! Ingredients??? over & over as “anti-Vaxxers” act all scared & suddenly “health conscious…”. It’s insane 🤯
1/-1	I’ve worked with long-haulers and it’s horrendous. Two of my own children dealt with some long-haul symptoms. I will continue to get boosted and continue to recommend it to nearly everyone. We still don’t know what the long-term effects of the virus will be and it keeps mutating, so best to stay as protected as possible.

1/1	Judging by some of these comments, there are a lot of people who don't believe in science or have any medical background.
0/0	Just Brain Blood Clots no big deal. Thanks Trump!
0/0	Just a friendly reminder that you can buy a scientist just as easy as you can buy a politician
1/1/1	Just because it didn't stem from the medical community that does not mean that it is not an actual benefit of being vaccinated. When the majority of the population is vaccinated against a certain disease it's more difficult for an outbreak to spread...let's not act like that's not a thing
0/-1	Just because it’s safe and effective for most people, does not mean it’s safe and effective for everyone.
0/0	Just because of abnormal wealth in the hands of medical mafia, Coronavirus became a tiger..Mass Vaccination is a stupid,cunning and cruel experiment.
1/1	Just because something can cause injury, pain or discomfort doesn't always mean it's bad no matter what. God made pathogens like polio, measles and smallpox, but he's also designed our immune systems to work in certain ways, and vaccination is one of the best ways for us to take advantage of what God has created for us.
1/1	Just because vaccines come with side effects doesn't mean they're not overall beneficial or necessary. The adverse effects are still far less troubling than contracting the actual disease, and if not for yourself you should still get vaccinated out of a sense of responsability towards your community - especially the most vulnerable
1/1	Just because you ‘feel fine’ doesn’t mean you won’t spread it. Get vaxxed!
1/1	Just booked my appointment for the booster. Let’s keep this protection strong

1/1	Just for Moderna👌 Cant wait for the 2nd shot
1	Just get vaccinated. It’s not rocket science that vaccines protect everybody. If not then oh well…
1/1	Just go to your local Walgreens or CVS. It took me all of 15 minutes to get in and out. I was lucky enough not to have any side effects because of the vaccine. Just get it. Better that than the ventilator.
1/1	Just got boosted! No side effects, just peace of mind.
1/1	Just got it for the first time last month. I slept 20 hours a day for almost 2 weeks. I’m vaccinated but severely immunocompromised. I think without the vaccine I’d be dead.
1/1	Just got mine and it was so quick. Glad i didn’t even get time to get anxious about it. A bit worried now, as always, about how my body might react, and I haven’t been ill in a while. Hopefully I can relax soon

1/1	Just got the J&J shot yesterday. The side effects are real but a good thing. It means my immune system is working
1/1	Just got the Johnson and Johnson and everyone is telling me I should’ve waited for another. But I know it doesn’t matter. Edit: As of May 6 I am fully vaccinated, if you read this please don’t reply or give any attention to anti vaxxers. Have a good day everyone :)
1/1	Just got the Sinovac vaccine. I honestly wanted Pfizer or Moderna, but I'm not complaining. With the Delta variant out right now, I'd just get the one that's immediately accessible because the rollout globally really depends on the supplies we have, especially in poorer countries where they do not have enough money to purchase vaccines. I'd figure that the more I put off vaccination, the faster virus mutates. I'd just want to say also that this is a great video since explains the reasons why it's important to get vaccinated sooner even if it were a less effective vaccine. It really is a race against time, so I'm glad I got inoculated.
1/1	Just got the vaccine! Only the first one. All I felt was tiredness and soreness! But I feel great!
1/1/1/1	Just got vaccinated

1/1/1/1	Just got vaccinated, not that bad tbh, only a sore arm
0/1	Just had a 38 year old coworker who had 3 shots diagnosed with a blood clot in the leg. No other known risk factors. Of course they’ll blame anything but the vax. All of the women on my immediate team are chronically ill - even in the summer in the South - with such severe respiratory issues that they regularly can’t speak in meetings.

1/1	Just in case anybody doesn't know if the COVID vaccine saved lives. It did. It undoubtedly saved millions of lives.
1/1	Just in case anybody doesn't know if the COVID vaccine saved lives. It did. It undoubtedly saved millions of lives. Let me show you the data Bobby.
0/0	Just like medicine, if you don't need a vaccine, dont take it. Exercise regularly and maintain a good sleep schedule—that's the best cure.
0/0	Just like the covid vaccine was a lie, we are living iin a world of brainwashing scientist. and sadly they have infected most of our young with their fake news. think for yourself stop being lead by the by the fakers.
1/1	Just popping in from a post apocalyptic looking Indian city to say , please listen to the cicada and get the vaccine ! My folks didn’t have the choice of which vaccine, but they got it, and it gave a few small side effects, but it works! My mum has COVID right now, despite getting dose 1 , but she has mild symptoms thanks to the vaccine. :)

1/-1	Just so my opinion on the Vax is Clear. 1. It was rushed 2. I am highly skeptical of the long-term side effects. 3. If I could go back I may not take it. 4. I respect those who took it and those who chose not to. Freedom.
0/0	Just stop lying already, there is no benefit to them whatsoever.
1/1	Just take it, it is for you and for protecting the elders. We take a lot other stuff into out body daily anyway

1/1	Just taken my Pfizer Booster..hmm quite Heaty.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
0/0	Just think about all of the private businesses and local governments that made employees get the experimental jab.
0/-1	Just think about it for a second they wanted to mandate shot for kids
0/0	Just thought I'd put this out there...my niece was vax injured from 1 shot, first roll out and on a waiting list for a heart transplant...SHE DIED LAST WEEK! 5YRS INJURED FROM 1 SHOT....SOMETHING SOME OF YOU MAYBE INTERESTED IN THAT IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY YOULL END UP LIKE HER! YEAH IM MAD
0/0/0	Just to make it understandable, there are 8000 serious side effects according to the usual.
1/0	Just updating the haters on my #flushot and #covidvacccine status. As you suggested, I did my own research… and ended up at CVS for both jabs today
0/0	Just want wish good luck to all the people out there participating in the experimental vaccine trial
1/1	Just watch people refuse to take it because they're antivax or because they don't believe in science.
0/0	Just watched a video on this, and I'm freaking stupid scared of what I heard and saw, not everyone would have the same symptoms BUT I don't think it's any good
0/0	Just you know a friend of mine ran a Covid unit at a VA hospital fully vaccinated people died within one week. Another friend was admitted at same VA very sick delta variant, he lived he was unvaccinated. All had delta variant.

1/0	Kid- I want to be a firefighter when I grow up! Anitvax mom- stop setting unrealistic goals. Kid- what part of being a firefighter is unachievable? Anitvax mom- it's not that, it's the "grow up" part.
1/1	Kids can get vaccinated now too! Finally, some peace of mind for parents
1/1	Kids can spread COVID and should be protected.
1/1	Kids:when i grow up Anti-vax parents:that where i’m gonna stop you
0/0	Killer vaccine
0/-1	Killing for money
0/0	Kinda ironic that I, someone who hasn't been "vaccinated", never has been infected by covid, unlike everyone else I know that has been
1/1	Knowing I’m doing my part to protect vulnerable individuals feels good.
1/1	Knowing I’m part of the solution to ending the pandemic feels amazing.
1/1	Knowing that I am protected motivates me to encourage others to get vaccinated.
1/1	Knowing the vaccine helps protect the elderly is reason enough to get it.
0/0	Knowing what we all know now. It was the right thing to do…. Unlike the UK government still dishing out Covid vaccines for the elderly with the flu vaccines at the end of the autumn. The who and the cover-up of the fact it came from a lab in China…. That needs investigation into how many more labs like that one creating what in effect is bio-weaponry?
0/0	Known side effects so far: Bell's palsy, severe sickness, miscarriage, and death. This shot is POISON.
0/0	Kudos to all the uninjected!
0/0/0	LAST YEAR TRUMPSTER CALLED COVID A HOAX ! WOULD HE LIE ???
0/0	LIES LIES LIES
0/0	LIES!!!!!!!! LIES!!!!!!!!! MY SISTER JUST GOT THE VACCINE AND NOW SHE IS VERY SICK WITH COVID 19 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1/0/0	LOL finally a decent comment instead of these salty adults that trust experts that really don't give af about any of us
0/0/0	LOL so he says the vaccine doesnt give you covid 19 virus but people are still testing positive for the virus after getting the vaccine despite not having it before taking the shot. Give me a break. This is a trial and we are nothing but human lab rats that arent certified or paid for our contributions.
0/0	Last Friday, my brother in law received his 2nd Moderna jab. 6 hours l8r. He's rushed to ER gasping for air as O2 numbers dropped to 86% from 100% prior to shot. Turns out he had a minor heart Attack. He's back home, but now is on oxygen as his O2 number plummet the moment he stands up. But I'm sure Dr Mike would say there is no correlation between the shot and the heart attack
1/1	Last sentence of the first paragraph of the article on this post. First sentence of the first paragraph for the FDA.gov article for the Pfizer and Moderna approvals which I'll link here: https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-and-authorizes-updated-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-better-protect-against-currently
1/1	Last year they were f*kicking hounding like dogs for vaccine and now when they are out they are like No it has this that. It’s like abusing the same doctors and scientists whom we once praised as corona gripped the world
1/0	Late summer and early fall are the best time to get vaccinated, the CDC says. In other words, before the vaccine is actually available?
1/1	Late to the thread here. From what I’ve read as far as the rna vaccines go, while the disease it’s fighting is new, the technology of an rna vaccine has been in development for 20 years or so. I think the science behind them is sound, yet I also agree that of course I wish there was the time to properly study any potential long term side effects. Unfortunately that’s not a viable option in today’s world. Good luck people. Stay healthy. Be safe.
0	Lately I’ve become very triggered when people say ‘get vaxed to keep others safe’ - it’s so illogical to me that I stopped acknowledging them
1/1	Leading scientists confirm vaccine effectiveness.
1/1	Learn something everyday. I have always thought it was to be 100% immunized. My nurse sister even says that. I now understand that is to prevent serious illness. It now makes sense why you get the flu shot. You might get sick but less likely to be extremely sick.
0/0	Leave the kids out of this mad experiment
1/0	Leave them to it cause some anti-vaccine supporters are not for having a civilised dialogue about it. They make a decision as an individual and live with it and time will show the outcome.
1/-1	Lemme guess: she was personally affected and now regrets being a fool and walking bioweapon?
1	Less stress, more safety with the vaccine!
1/1	Let Indian government give emergency approval for corona vaccinations by year end
0/0	Let me get a grave plot with a headstone first!
0/0	Let me know how your doing on your 555th booster sheep. I’m good on never taking it.
0/0	Let me save you 6 minutes. Poison.
1/0	Let the anti vaxxers risk their own life at their own discretion! We that have the vaccine should be good, right? And yes, I know homeless people (& you can't say the poor, because vaccines are not expensive). But kinda same as the anti vaxxers, if they deny, nor even will search for help themselves, isn't that the homeless' problem ️️
0/-1	Let the rich take the shots first
0/0	Let us insult people with legitimate concerns this will win them over.
0/0	Let your body take care of it like it always had
0/0/0	Let's add to the list: Masks don't work. Lockdowns don't work. The vaccines don't work. It's getting into the late 3rd quarter in 2023 before an election year. It's about time to pull out the mask/lockdown new variant talk so they can fuck with the 2024 election.
0/0	Let's assume side effects related to the COVID vaccines are difficult to prove, and there is more happening than we are hearing. I am the last in my family and friend group to be unvaccinated.
0/0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
1/1	Let's everyone gets vaccinated and don't make over work, have some good rest and feel the antibodies killing virus
0/-1	Let's face it - the whole thing is being rushed through, not for the sake of the health of the people but for the sake of the economy and profit....then again the two are probably linked.
1/1	Let's hope the vaccines are effective and give long term immunity without any long term unwanted side effects
0/1	Let's keep up the fight don't give them an inch.
0/0	Let's see how long this comment stays up. I had the first Pfizer shot and was hospitalised in the following weeks as a result of it. Never had another shot of anything. I was not the only one hospitalised during that time for the same reasons my GP told me.
1/-1	Let's see just how much we can get away with"
0/0	Let's think this through. Healthy people are not profitable.
0/0/0/0/1	Let’s create a medicine to create many kinds of serious illnesses, oh we just did!
1/1	Let’s not shame people for asking questions. Instead, let’s give them reliable answers from medical professionals. 🤝
1/1	Let’s pray to god scientists find a vaccine to get rid of this terrible virus. Like 255 Dislike Reply
1	Let’s protect each other! Vaccines work!
0/0	Let’s take a moment of silence, for those of us who resisted, to thank our innate instinct to survive and our primal intuition for the warning of Danger Ahead.
0/0	Liar liars modifying a human RNA is dangerous and will have unintended consequences. Some humans will mutate into something unknown or pass that modification to their children
0/0	Liar.. It cause more worse than before
0/0	Lie everyone I know including my sister was very sick after the vaccine.
0/0	Lies and lies. All the people involved in pushing these shots are profiting. They are not free, they are billions to the pharmaceutical industry.
0/0	Lies lies lies!
0/-1	Lies lies lies.
0/0	Lies, Lies, and more Lies......
0/0	Lies. All Lies.
0/0	Life is full of tradeoffs and hindsight. I have people in my life who are older and severely immune compromised. I got the shot in the initial phase in 2021. Once it was clear that it had no impact on transmission, I was OUT. No more.
1/-1	Like every vaccine
1/1/1	Like it or not for most people in the whole damn world, the benefits DO far outweigh the risks! Full stop!
0/-1	Like vaccine s we do no indepth study,just get that poison on market as fast as possible
1/-1	Liked before watching
0/0	Listen I’m pro vaccination but when it is made fast like this I question if it’s safe so I will not be taking it
0/0	Listen closely. A test of trust. The politicisation that vaccines are safe for you and protect others. It’s a social experiment using a weapon. My guess is our natural immune system and the level of trust is much of a problem than they had hoped.
1/1	Listen we all are vaccinated for mumps/chicken pox/polio & others. This is no different. Stop being idiots and ruining it for the majority of us who have been vaccinated. It’s time to stop pandering to the 30% unvaccinated and focus on getting the world vaccinated so there are no more variants.
1/-1	Literally delusional. I feel so bad for his family/kids, he has put them through unnecessary trauma. And he continues to be ignorant. It’s like he is not even grateful for the hospital care he has received. His attitude is unbelievable.
1/1	Literally everyone I know has gotten the vaccine and everyone is FINE.
1/1	Literally everyone I know took it because they were concerned for their health.
1/1	Literally got four vaccines today. So far so good.
1/0	Living in Alabama scares the shit out of me. I have a very serious cardiac condition, which qualified myself for an early (Pfizer) vaccine, yet my fellow citizens have lost their collective minds. It makes me sick.
1/1	Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0/0	Lmao no matter how bad you make anti-vaxxers seem. Majority of people are now realising how bad vaccines really is.
0/0	Loads of issues since I was vaccinated and my Dad and Aunt ended up with dementia 1 month apart from their second jab. They’re two years apart - 67 and 69 years of age.
1/1	Local news did a story on a vaccine going to human trial. Naturally the comment section is filled with idiots calling it dangerous...
0/0	Lock them up. Their plan was to depopulate or make people more sick so they become reliant on more pharmaceuticals. Are people still not believing the direct correlation between turbo cancers and these experimental poison vaccines. It was all part of the PLANdemic
0/0	Lockdowns didn’t work, why would the vaccine?
0/0	Lockdowns were bad, vaccines won’t change anything.
1/1	Logical conclusion: ANOTHER reason to get the vaccine
0/0/0	Lol all squaking its funny keep going im enjoying it he just got in and no one has shown the science of the vaccine so hood luck finding it like whats actually in it
0/1	Lol get you boosters everyone.
0/0	Lol i didnt get it because i just have a fear of syringes badly
0/0	Lol imagine if it the situation was reversed. Doctor: Those anti-biotics seemed to have worked well, there's no sign of infection. Patient: Yes, but how can you be sure the infection didn't just clear up itself? These people are doing absolute mental gymnastics to avoid the obvious. Glad I never took the shot.
0/1	Lol so not only are the refusing to get the only protection against this killer virus, but they're also getting rid of their health insurance by quitting. Very smart group of people were dealing with obviously 😂
0/-1	Lol these guys really said the spike protein is harmless
0/-1	Lol this is a joke right?
0/0	Lol. Safe??? The data is showing 1-3 YEARS life span for these people who are fully vaxxed. 🙄 yeah, safe alright 👍.. 😄
1/-1	Lol... This lady need to go to India or Brazil and speak with those who lost their family friends, parents! Total ignorant!
1/1	Long COVID is a serious risk—vaccination lowers that risk.
1/1	Long COVID is no joke. The vaccine lowers your risk—get it!
1/1	Long COVID is real, and it’s no joke. A vaccine is better than months of health issues.
1/1	Long COVID is real. If a jab can help, I’m taking it.
0/0	Long covid is from the vaccine. 🤢
1/1	Long covid is still a thing, and vaccinating against covid is the best way to prevent it. 54 and got both covid and flu shot.
1/1	Long term covid can be avoided if you just get the vaccine!!!
0/0	Long term effects unknown
0/0	Long term effects? I know it does not edit DNA so no genetic damage but it could still cause some problems.
0/0	Long-term side effects? No one knows.
1/-1	Long-term studies are ongoing, but data is reassuring.
0/0/0	Look Dr., I just don’t want to die. I was forced to get this vaccine, and I just want to live my life in peace and experience things. I got the vaccine at 19 and I’m now 21 with heart issues. I just don’t want to die. Is there anything I can do for myself, or am I doomed?
1/1	Look at all these Doomsday-Daniels acting like their body is a temple too good for a vaccine. Meanwhile, they’ll eat processed food laced with chemicals, binge drink, and wave off the dangers of heart disease
0/0	Look at all these young athletes getting cardiac arrest because of the "safe & effective" booster shots smh. Big pharma must be stopped!
0/0	Look at radium back in the early 1900 hundreds, the people thought it was safe, until something messy happened
1/1	Look no one wants to put stuff in their bodies but vaccines save lives. I live with someone severely immunocompromised so we vax! I have friends who lost family & I have family who died from COVID, others, young w long COVID so we vax! Polio -Tetnus -Hepatitis-Pneumonia &Covid
0/0	Look up the world renowned virologist geert vanden bossche ! No mass vaccinations! So dangerous! Remember Biden is giving out $1billion of the stimulus for brainwashing you all by the media and so called doctors to convince you to get the poison jab! Wake up!
1/1	Looking back on the evidence, it would seem like places that had higher rates of vaccinations had a lower rate of Covid 19 Hospitalizations
1/1	Looking forward to getting a covid booster along with my annual flu vaccination. Reject the health benefits of modern medicine at your own peril.
1/1	Looking forward to receiving the vaccine I am 82
1/1	Looking forward to this vaccine helping across our country and the world getting rid of this deadly virus
1/1	Looking terrific in spite of your shot! Glad you got vacillated and no more worried about Covid. ❤️
0/0	Looks like mark of the Beast stuff to me... no thanks
1/-1	Looks like we won't need social distancing anymore
1/1	Loomba et al. found that exposure to online misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines declined vaccination intent significantly in both the U.S. (6.4% points) and U.K (6.2% points) samples.
1/1	Lost my best friend at 26 to Covid, and an aunt who was battling cancer. Every time I see someone argue about it (wearing masks, getting vaccinated) I get so enraged, so depressed, I feel like it’s impossible to get over it because it’s so difficult to escape the constant reminders that this could’ve been easily combated if everyone was selfless and committed to keeping each other safe. Please get vaccinated. Please wear a mask. Please don’t have mass gatherings. Your lives are worth it.
1/1	Lost my husband Mike to covid! Wish he could of gotten the shot when I did. Everyone please get vaccinated!
0/0	Lost my job due to the vaccine requirements from the authorities and office politics. Never regretted not taking the vaccines. Those evil managers and bosses are still alive today despite having taken the Covid vaccines.
1/-1	Lots of next gen Covid vaccines under development. Here’s a scientific blog post on it: https://absolutelymaybe.plos.org/2024/07/31/more-signs-of-broad-protection-from-next-generation-covid-vaccines-update-19/
0/0	Lots of people are willing to do the VAX versus unvaxed study. The pharmaceutical industry will never do that study because they know that the outcome will not be in their best interest.
0/0/0	Lots of people catch COVID after the vaccine and a high right of the hospitalized individuals with the omicron variant were "fully" vaxed.
0/0	Love when a fully vaccinated and right up to date person tells me that they have had covid 3-5 times and could not get off the couch or that they got long time covid and have been sick for 2 months. And what flavour of poison do you want in your arm this time
1/1	Lowered efficacy but still effective in reducing hospitalizations and deaths, isn't that what they reported?
0/0	Lucky… that vaccine has ruined a lot of lives including mine and I only received 1 shot.
1/1	MAGAtards dont trust the vaccine, yet Pfizer.....the company that patented the C-19 vaccine....is one of the largest investments Trump has in the stock market. So, by their logic, why would Trump invest in a company that would harm Americans?
1/1	MANY SERIOUS DISEASES HAVE BEEN ERADICATED WITH VACCINES.

0/0	MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WILL DIE WHEN GIVEN THE VACCINE COVID 19 IS NOTHING MORE THEN A COLD ...ONLY TELLS ME HOW CLOSE GOD IS TO RETURNING AND WILL REPAY EVIL WITH EVIL ...
0/1	MMR vaccines became popular when children began being raised in daycare. Not all children died of measles, mumps, & rubella prior to the vaccine. Parents knew how to treat their sick children (ie. measle sufferers were kept in a dark room with no TV so that the virus could not affect the optic nerve). Sick kids were not allowed to play with their friends or go to school. Today’s parents don’t have the patience to deal with a sick child. Sick children disrupt parents’ daily schedules. Parents today want their kids either in daycare or school during daylight hours, not home having to be entertained. MMR vaccine has certainly made parents’ lives much easier.

1/-1	Make a copy of the original, laminate it and keep it in your wallet. Keep the original in a safe place. You can add to it if ever necessary.
0/0	Make sure you get vaccinated with a shot that doesn’t work or wear a mask that didn’t work. Just never mind the 12 inch clot they will pull out of you in a few years.
1/1	Makes sense - it was fantastic to get it out there so quickly, but there are better vaccines now. I was very grateful that this was available for my elderly parents as soon as it was though, and happily got my own vaccine when I could.
1/1	Man I didn't know they essentially speed ran making the vaccines! I'm due to get vaccinated soon since I caught covid early this year so it's kinda cool learning how this stuff is made - I mean it's gonna be put inside of me I kinda want to know how it does it's business at least

1/1	Mandate the passenger especially essential workers. They are going to have to be vaccinated when overseas or cross border opens up again. Get the vaccine shot(s) to eliminated this virus
0/0	Mandates created more division than the virus did.
0/0	Mandates were a violation of our rights.
0/0/0	Mandating a vaccine for which the manufacturers take no responsibility is reprehensible IMO. Where there is risk there must always be choice.
0/0	Mandating a vaccine for work is unfair and coercive.
0/0	Mandating a vax goes against the very thing most precious to an American............Freedom.
1/1/1	Mandating vaccines for public safety is a reasonable measure.

0/0	Many family and friends vaccinated have been sick repeatedly with bouts of COVID, walking pneumonia, viral infections which ER are unable to identify. Currently 5 are struggling to recover
0/1	Many interpreted the 95% effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine as insufficient.

1/-1	Many participants in Study 1 indicated they had not been exposed to COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, which might be a positive sign.
0/-1	Many people are forced to get a vaccine so that they don't get infected with COVID, but I also think that it might affect my health in the future, so it's scary.

0/0	Many people have died suddenly or developed previously rare diseases like guilliane barre syndrome or myocarditis or pericarditis. Thats why you don't mandate it
0/0	Many people only got vaccinated because they wanted to travel freely. They don’t actually believe it works.
1/1	Many pharmaceutical companies invested significant resources in developing a vaccine for COVID. The emergency situation required an emergency response.
0/0	Many restrictions still exist even after vaccination—this feels like a scam.
0/0	Many thanks, the two soiboys totally convinced me to not get this shit.
0/0	Many vaccinated people regret getting the shot.
0/0/0	Many vaccinated people still end up in the hospital.
1/1	Many vaccines don't pass Phase 1 trials. So covid vaccines are able to pass, undergo rigorous testing, and get approved.
1/-1	Many workplaces require vaccination to ensure safety.
0/0	Mark of the Beast! I will NEVER take it. Jesus Christ is my one and only savior. Only him do I bow to!

0/0	Mass Covid 19 Vaccine Deaths gonna become regular if not more rapid
0/-1	Mass formation of the sheeps. Money making for the elites.
1/1	Mass vaccination is key to ending the pandemic.
0/0	Mass vaccination might actually speed up virus mutations—isn’t this just harming people?
1/1	Mathematically speaking, effectively 0% of the 14 billion vaccinations administered led to people who got very sick or died from it. What makes you think you would?
1/1	May God bless those good people who care enough to get vacinated and stop the spread! amen
0/0	May God have mercy on all the old people who has no one to fight for them to not take the vaccines God will judge them all for what they are doing to the people

1/1	May I ask what planet the people are living on where there's not a pandemic going on?
0/0	May I ask why the covid vaccines have not been granted as safe for use, but granted for use in emergency situations only. All odd
1/0	May that guy who doesn’t want the vaccine get a huge bill from the hospital
1/1	Maybe 30% will refuse the vaccine, but I really hope they’ll feel ashamed of their decision when they realize the harm they're causing.
0/-1	Maybe I misheard all of the people making claims over the last couple of years, but wasn't the concern primarily for children and teenagers? This study was 45 and up. Not saying this study isn't valid or anything, but it doesn't exactly prove the anti-vax claim to be wrong.
1/1	Maybe because science is evolution? It isn't because the Mumps vaccine was developed in 1961 and it took 4 years that the same should happen now. Just think how you no longer need to buy that band cd or wait for your favorite song to play in the radio anymore because everything is one touch away.
0/0	Maybe because they are rushed untested and there like 10 different versions of the same “vaccine”???
0/0/-1	Maybe must relearn first how a strict intramuscular injection can be done to avoid risk of accidental intravesel inject.
0/0	Maybe we don't need an unproven and untested mRNA vaccine for something with a 99% survivability rate.

0/0	Me and my family are not taking the drug
1/1	Me and my friends took the shot and there are no side effects
0/0/0	Me and my husband didn't get the shot, got sick in 2022 after taking a trip. We are thriving. My sister got it now has an autoimmune disease, my cousin got it now has rapid neurological issues ( he can't form words), other cousin got it, now has rapid heart rate, mother in law got it got rapid leukemia and myocarditis, church member got it can't straighten his neck, heart issues.

0/0	Meanwhile, march 2024...pureblood here. This video sure didn't age well, did it? No regrets for myself or my family, which was protected from these ghouls!
1/0	Melissa’s situation is very confusing to me. Her daughter relies on herd immunity, yet she campaigns against vaccines. That makes no sense.
1/0	Melissa’s situation is: her daughter absolutely relies on herd immunity, no one is disputing that her kid can’t be vaccinated, it happens, but that makes it more important for her daughter that other people are vaccinating.
0/-1	Men in this study were less likely than women to accept vaccines in general or their employer’s recommendation to get vaccinated

0/0	Mild short term side effects are common BUT who has documented long term effects later after a vaccine on this is administered ???

1/1	Minimal side effects, maximum protection. Vaccines work!
0/0	Miracles of a cure for a killer virus!!! I am for medical purposes and cures! But come on! A few months on vaccine to help them and cure??? It takes a least 5yrs for a vaccine to be certified! 5 10yrs top!! I pray for world! My faith in God and not in to magical cures right away! Any professional doctors would say a cure made in few months would not be possible or be safe after so long to be used!! If you said few years ago a killer virus going come and vaccine is made a few months later...you be told it would never be allowed for any vaccine to be used ! Dangerous time's people! Stay safe and faithful in one God to keep you safe.
0/-1	Misinformation about the new COVID-19 vaccines and their development process has the potential to induce high levels of vaccine hesitancy in the public.
1/1	Misinformation is costing lives. Stop spreading conspiracy theories and start trusting real experts. 📢

1/1	Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine is 94.5% effective, according to company data.
0/0	More Propaganda. I know more about vaccines and viruses now. Enough to fill a book. If this virus is so deadly why do we need a test to prove we have it? People would be dropping like flies. They’d be hauling people out of their homes, men women,and children all dead. This is a very, very, contagious virus that was released by Communist China Government, at the RIGHT Time. It harms the weak, the old, the frail, the sickly. Same as ALL Contagious Pathogens and other know diseases. This is to control us and put FEAR into us. If you use a vaccine and you are young and healthy, you already have a strong immune system. If you are old and sickly you have a weak immune system, and a vaccine can burden it. Americans by and large are not exactly the healthiest in diet and exercise habits. This is the cornerstone of good health, diet , exercise, and what we put into our minds.
0/0	More and more people vaccinated yet cases still going up. Almost like it didn't work. How about the variants? Like flu, when does it end? Constant boosters. Constant pharma profits. Constant tax dollar drain.
0/0	More boosters? No thanks.
0/0	More boosters? When does it end?
0/0	More like short life after vaccine
1/0	More mandatory vaccines on the way with 15 booster shots for the sheeple...
0/0	More money for big pharma supported by government scare tactics. That’s all this is. No one is listening anymore
0/0	More often than NOT any Vax or Drug has worse side effects than whats its trying to Treat. Having a healthy immune system works just fine for me amigos, Ill still take a hard pass on those jabs.

1/1	More vaccines for me
1/1	More vaccines mean fewer deaths!
0/0	More, way more. The best and only way to fight back is to NEVER comply. Then sue the ***t out of them.
1/1	Most anti-vaxxers I meet argue "child-diseases" are a phase children need to go through, like deciduous teeth. They tend forget that "child-diseases" are called that way because children infected with those diseases often died before even reaching adolescence. "Child-" as a prefix seems to downplay the seriousness of it all.
1/1	Most booster shots by the end of the season wins Most Vaccinated Player
0/-1	Most deaths are from ventilator protocols not the virus
1/1	Most human advances & breakthroughs are at times of catastrophes.
1/1	Most large offices have flu shot drives in office, which probably contributed to increasing vaccination rates. With many of those same offices now only housing a fraction of the staff, with the rest being remote, there isn't the same capacity to warrant the drives.
0/0	Most of my doctors patients are vax injured. He has few of us who developed long C through infection. He told me I made the right choice by not getting vaccinated.
1/1	Most of my friends who didn’t get the vaccine got Covid. I got the vaccine. Never got Covid. How peculiar
1/1	Most of the supposed facts that the anti vaxxers brought up were simply not true lol
1/1	Most of us have already taken it. Now do you wanna die alone with the loonies or do you wanna die with us.
1/1	Most parents who are fully vaccinated and have recently gotten a booster
0/0	Most people I know that got multiple vaccines say they wished they hadn’t gotten it. And noticed their health being abit slanted considering
1/1	Most people alive judge this vaccines with privileged eyes. Privileged to know life after vaccines and not understand the true enemy, communicable disease.

0/0	Most people have mild symptoms without vaxx as well.
0/-1	Most people who got COVID recovered just fine.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Most people who took the thing have yet to realise that they have been harmed.

1/0	Most successful protocol, carry on & vax more n more.....life saving ones..congrats!😈👹😈ha....ha....ha.....
1/1	Most vaccines aren’t developed during a global pandemic… it seems counterintuitive that you’d want many people to get infected when testing a vaccine… However those vaccines were also made a long time ago, science has obviously come very far…
0/0	Mr. President: with all due respect, I'd rather quit my job and eat horse paste.
0/0	Mrna is highly toxic to the human body, How can it cure cancer? When it already started with the covid shot, is the cause for Turbo cancers already.. I think it's great to start looking for a cure for cancer but Mrna technology isn't the way..
0/1	Multi billion dollar corporations and government want to inoculate me for my protection sounds legit where do I sign up? Does it come with a free microchip or maybe a free Elon Musk brain implant?
1/1	My 11 year old cannot wait for the vaccine. When we boarded our dogs recently he overheard us talking about our dogs getting their shots, and was briefly infuriated that the DOGS were getting a Covid vaccine before him!
0/1	My 14 year old daughter recently had Covid. Recovered fine. Was at the pediatrician for something unrelated. My wife asked when she would be eligible to get the vax after having Covid. His response ‘3 months, or better yet Never’...from her pediatrician! We’ll pass on giving the shot to our kids.
1/1	My 17 year old has been fully vaccinated, and my 15 year will probably do a double back flip on roller skates into the chair to get hers. We've already discussed it, and she's ready to have her life back! Watching a TWO year old suffer from Covid will dramatically change your perspective. The majority of Gen Z believes in science unless their parents tell them otherwise.

0/0	My Mum had all her Covid boosters, Phizer - died of these specific strokes recently. Was a healthy 72, sharp witted and happy - never had a history of strokes in the family at all.
1/0	My Mum has had both doses of her vaccine and still managed to get coronavirus and got sick really badly with it. This vaccine gives us hope but it’s not a way out of it
0	My Question is : If a person has already contacted Covid -19 wouldn’t that person body already has a defense system set up to prevent the virus from entering the body?
0/0	My Uncle had a massive heart attack a week or two after taking the vaccine
0/0	My Wife and I have never had a COV or Flu shot and we're the only ones in our family that have not been ill at all this Winter. Go figure. Remember what we were told would happen to us if we chose not to get the COV jab?!

0/0	My aunt had to get a pacemaker in 2 weeks after the jab and my dad had a stroke within 2 months of the booster. Neither had any major health issues in their lifetime but suddenly had major health issues shortly after the jab. L
1/1	My aunt suffered from the effects of polio until she died. And she was one of the lucky ones who didn’t end up in an iron lung. Diseases like polio, and other debilitating or life-threatening illnesses, are nothing to play around with. We’re fortunate to have vaccines to lessen the risk of getting them and to reduce the effects of the disease if we do get them.
1/1/1	My aunt survived Polio, my father TB, my kids have survived Nintendo thumb, thank you vaccines!
1/1	My autoimmune disorder caused me to have a really strong inflammatory response to my second shot and even as I kvetched about my painful, swollen joints and inability to get out of bed I knew I had to immediately follow up every complaint with a "but I'm glad I got vaccinated please get vaccinated too" lest I scare someone out of getting their own shot.
1/1	My baby got the covid vaccine along with the flu vaccine and all the other standard vaccines at the same time at his 6 month check up. His fussiness after the vaccines was no worse (and in fact seemed to be a bit better) than when he got his prior vaccines. He was completely fine (no fussiness) by the next morning. I’ve noticed zero side effects since then (it’s been almost a month). I have no regrets that he got the vaccines and I’m much more relaxed when he’s around people now.
1/1/1/1	My baby received every vaccination on time. His record went to school when he started kindergarten. He's now a grown man and I'm pleased.
0/0	My best decision was to avoid the COVID vaccine
1/1	My best friend of over 30 yrs didn't make it to the vaccine. She passed in January from COVID. I'm so grateful my entire family has been vaccinated.
0/0	My best friend was in perfect health until he took this shot. Now he’s struggling with heart issues. But sure, ‘rare.’
0/0	My best friend's husband, a healthy hockey trainer, ended up having to get a pacemaker due to unexplained heart issues after the 2nd shot. They tried doing it through the vein, but too many clots. After that, he had multiple mini-strokes. Poor guy can't remember anything. We went on vacation together. He remembers going but can't tell you anything about the week. I try to talk to them about it, but they won't hear it. He even got a booster after all of that. So sad.
0/0	My best friends boss died 5 days after getting the vaccine. He took second shot, got very sick, was in hospital for 4 days, then on day 5 they discharged him. AS he was walking out of the hospital, he dropped dead. Turns out he died from a blood clot.

0	My bipolar & anxiety were medically well-controlled for 15yrs+ then couple months after 2nd vaccine, mental illness completely uncontrolled — Got fired from job after 10yrs of stellar performance evals/outcomes. Something just radically CLICKED on or off in my mind, and MDs still tinkering around with medication levels to no avail…living with uncontrolled bipolar & anxiety since vaccine. Causal vs correlated, I know, I know, but lancet did publish some cases re: psychotic breaks & COVID vaccine. IDK, and even if there was some scientific “evidence” of causation, no one gives a flying f@ck about just another mentally ill nuisance.

0/0	My boss took the vaccine. Has a heart issue now after getting his covid shots. Can't get his heart rate up too much otherwise he has a chance of a heart attack.
1/1	My boy is going to get it. Would rather not risk have him getting long covid which is much higher risk than adverse reaction to the vaccine. Everything has a risk. I have weighed up the options and believe this is the best choice. I am no doctor but would rather trust medical professionals on this than someone spouting BS on YouTube or Bitchute
0/0	My boyfriend and I refused the "covid vaccine" for us and our children and so glad we resisted the pression from gouvernement and society !!!
1/1	My boyfriend refused to get vaccinated, so I broke up with him.
1/1	My brother and I both had this, though our GP misdiagnosed it as costochondritis initially. We both got checked out at A&E as a precaution (which was when they realised the mistake). It cleared up on its own. Bit uncomfortable, but a few years earlier, mono/glandular fever nearly killed me and destroyed my tonsils, so I'll take the vaccine, I'm good with that.
0/0	My brother died of "crib death" as a baby after he was vaccinated. Cause of death Sudden infant death syndrome. Is it a coincidence?
1/-1	My brother had his jab on the 15th January 2021, Queen Mary University London. I phone him on Monday night 18th, he said he had a little bump where they jab him but he feel fine no side effects this was 72 hours after having the vaccine.. I'm 60 so still waiting for mine
0/0	My brother in law got covid19 and is now having the stroke-like symptoms. I had covid19 , got through it fine and I will not get the jab now.
0/0	My brother is fully vaccinated.. he's had COVID eight times since the first injection. I'm completely unvaccinated and have not had COVID ever... interesting.
1/0	My brother just missed the vaccine by a couple of weeks. He died of covid and he was only 73. Just beginning to enjoy his retirement with his lovely wife. I’ll take my chances on the vaccine.
1/1	My brother was an antivaxer. He died of Covid last August 27th. He was in good health. He was 57.
0/-1	My brother works in the private sector and to go do deals in New York, he had to have proof of the vaccine. He didn’t get it either. His HR person made him a fake card.
1/1	My cardiologist Dr Fialkow, has reviewed all the available data possible on the vaccine and tells me to get it as soon as it is available to me. I have 100% faith in his recommendation.

0/0	My children and myself will not recieve this vaccine
0/0	My children's father passed away on June 21, 2021, just under six months after getting the vaccine in January. I am certain the vaccine is what caused his death. Both of my children are struggling to cope with the loss, and I can't even begin to comprehend the immense harm the vaccine has caused. The damage done to the world by this is beyond belief.
0/0	My choice and I choose NOT to be vaxed I’ve had friends fully vaccinated and got COVID and died. So no thanks!!
0/1	My company recently announced that vaxxed people can go maskless starting in a week, and it’s all honor system. The anti-vaxxer in our group has been steaming since the announcement...TBD what he does...does he just lie (but everyone in the group *knows* he’s anti-vax)?, or does he comply with the rules and continue with the mask (which he’s bitched about since the beginning)?? Fun times!
0/-1	My company said you can't come to work without getting vaccinated, so I had no choice but to get it.

0/0	My cousin is a nurse, she sees what the vaccines do to people. She is refusing to be an expiriment.
1/1	My cousin just had his second dose. After his first shot, he felt fine. After the second, he felt terrible the next day. His entire body ached, he had extreme fatigue, chills, and a 102 temperature. But he felt better the day following that. EDIT: To clarify, I am NOT saying he got covid from the vaccine. It was the side effects, which btw, were listed in the video.
1/1	My cousin was an avid antivaxxer. He died a few days ago from Covid after spending months in the hospital. He went from a ventilator to a tracheotomy. He left all of his anti vax crap up all over his Facebook page up til the very end. It's horribly sad.
1/-1	My cousin went to the hospital with symptoms of a heart attack but they were so overwhelmed with covid patients that they sent him home without doing any tests and he dropped dead on his bathroom floor getting ready for work the next day.
0/0	My cousin's friend died 3 days after her booster - coincidence?
0/0	My cousins kids side effect was ALS. He’s 32 and now has about 3 years to live. He just got married, was perfectly healthy before the jab. Was in a wheelchair in less than 6 months after the jab. Said he wishes he never got that shot. Very sad, breaks my heart. Neurodegenerative disorders are listed on fizers safety docs that were released per court order. There are 9 pages of serious side effects. Go download and read them. I have.

1/1	My coworker refused the vaccine and ended up really sick. Glad I took mine.
0/0	My creator gave me a great immune system - no chemicals going in this body !!!
0/0	My creator gave me natural immunity. Thanks but no thanks.
0/0	My dad almost died after getting his Covid shot. He was hospitalized then eventually moving to a retirement home. He lost the ability to walk after being bedridden for so many months. Doctors were quick to deny that the shot had anything to do with it. They were quick to change the subject too.
1/1	My dad didn’t wanna get it, then he got COVID and it hit him HARD. He got the shot as soon as he recovered.
0/0	My dad died of encephalitis after his second shot
0/0	My dad dropped dead a month after his second dose. He just turned 59. They didn’t wanna do an autopsy. I had a feeling that morning upon finding him. It didn’t make sense. He was healthy.
0/0	My dad got a bloot clot in his intestine shortly after getting vaccinated ....and he still got covid and had worse symptoms than me, he still has complications due to the loss of blood flow to his intestine for days due to the blood clot..
0/0	My dad got vaccinated and he still got sick like never before with covid19 so is vaccines are BS
0/0	My dad had a heart attack and he blames the vaccine. He’s not overweight, exercises, eats healthy, and we have no family history of heart conditions.
1/0	My dad had an autoimmune reaction to a vaccine given by the military that made him unable to continue working, or even walk up and down stairs or stay standing for long periods of time (it's better now, since there are newer medicines that control his symptoms with fewer side effects). It turns out they had given him and the other people on the base much higher doses and with far shorter intervals between shots than is recommended. So I have a legitimate reason to be cautious of vaccines. And you know what? Even with that my whole family keeps up to date on our vaccines, because we know that what happened to my dad wasn't the fault of vaccine, it was doctors trying to rush things and breaking protocols that are in place for a reason.

I have no sympathy for people who claim that vaccines are bad for people because a TV celebrity told them so. I don't let them off the hook with the excuse that they are just ignorant. They are willfully ignoring tremendous amounts of data that almost irrefutably prove them wrong, and they put their lives, their children's lives, and everyone else's lives at risk because of it.
0/0	My dad had blood clots cancer and a stroke after the shot. Now he's about to expire.
0/0	My dad had both shots and died from Covid, WHILE he was in the hospital. He didn't have Covid when he was admitted.
1/0	My dad had one shot and no symptoms when he got covid.. I seen other patients with 4 shots die
0/0	My dad has symptoms after the shot, which did not stop, he had a scan, low and behold a tumour was found.
0/-1	My dad passed away in his sleep last nite .. he was healthy 75 played tennis 3 x a week . I think it's plausible the covid vaccines played a part. Should I request an autopsy ?? What do I look for
1/1	My dad took his 2 months ago, he's fine, absolutely no side effects, let alone still being alive.
0/0	My dad took the vaccine perfectly. Healthy became paralyzed and unfortunately now dead
0/0	My dad, step dad and wife's dad all moved on... They all died. Fully vaccinated!
1/0	My dads a republican so when i went to go get my covid shot he said i was going to grow 3 eyes and i did
0/0	My dad’s body quit producing blood, has to go in every 2 weeks to get blood transfusions . My mom and aunt have a since formed a very aggressive dementia. My other aunt was five years breast cancer free had the check up in Aug.2021 confirmed, got the Pfizer vaccine in November 2021. Breast cancer came back metastasized in her back so bad it disintegrated her bones was dead by March of 2022. My cousin 39 got the vaccine had a detached retina. My friend 34 has since developed hypertension. My mother in law had a stroke is going to be on blood thinners the rest of her life. My father in law went septic almost died. It took 8 months for him to recover. All of these people in my life received the vaccine, all of them have had reactions. It angers me so badly when people deny the covid vaccines are dangerous, I have found people online with similar reactions after receiving the vacations. Of course they aren’t going to come out and admit it. They are going to wait until a majority die off. Think about how much money that will cost them and let’s admit that right now that’s what Covid has been about the whole time.
0/0	My daughter 36 went into cardiac arrest and stopped breathing 2 years ago today. She is in a nursing home in a vegetative state. All from the 1st COVID shot.😢
0/0/0	My daughter has an auto immune disease that she has been dealing with for over 7 years. It took about 5 years to get her feeling better although her disease is still there. She is 18 now and elects to not get any covid vaccines at this time. She has been through way too much with being sick etc that she doesn’t want the possibility of this vaccine causing her more issues. I support her decision.
1/1	My daughter is almost 3, she’s healthy, has never had covid even when exposed, has had only mild versions of the flu or colds once since starting daycare, and I am so so so glad I got her vaccinated to protect her.
1/1	My daughter's pediatrician recommended it at her 6 month appointment, so we got it.
0/0	My deeply held religious beliefs prevent me from getting vaccinated. Sorry, Gov, it ain't going to happen.
1/1	My diabetic 13 year old grandson has been vaccinated. That was a huge relief. I was happy when my 7 year old grandson became eligible. He has only one functioning kidney.
0/0	My doctor didn’t even want to take it himself
0/0	My doctor nearly died from a Pfizer shot from severe reactions including chest and heart pains
1/1	My doctor prescribed my vaccination because of my health issues, I haven't had any problems with the shot
1/1	My doctor recommended the updated booster for me now to give babe a little protection in addition to the booster I got in late March (baby is due in October) and then vaccine for baby at 6 months. I’ve read enough about the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing severe disease that I feel comfortable both getting boosted while pregnant and having baby vaccinated once they’re of age.
0/0	My doctor said to me "Whatever you do, do NOT take the covid vaccine". There are great doctors out there.
0/0	My doctor took the vaccine to keep his job. He got so sick the next day that he almost died. He told me not to get it.
0/0	My doctor tried twice to get me take the vax, but I refused. I remember the last time he asked me, he told me he took the vax. I told him I told him I trust Jesus to take care of me, but if I did COVID and passed away it was my time to die. He never asked me again.

1	My entire family got the vaccine, some who have heart problems, diabetes, or are just healthy. None of us had problems, the youngest of us was 16, and the oldest 87. I feel like this vaccine is just as effective as vaccines that have been administered in the past.
1/1	My entire family has been very careful during Covid. We are ALL vaccinated and boosted and we’re all still alive. Several of us have frontline jobs. My family means everything to me.
1/1	My entire family is vaccinated, and we feel much safer because of it.
1/1	My entire family is vaccinated. We haven’t had severe COVID since 2021.
1/1	My ex husband and his brother refused to be vaccinated. As a nurse, I tried to explain how vaccinations work, but to no avail. Both got COVID. My ex accepted treatment with monoclonal antibodies, but still refuses the vaccine. His brother DIED from COVID. Even being tragically affected by COVID, my ex husband continues to refuse to even wear a mask. It’s insane.
1/1	My family and I been vaccination multiple times and nothing bad happened. I mean seriously, was that seriously their excuse for making false information about vaccination?
1/1	My family and I have received the COVID-19 vaccine. The whole process went smoothly, making us feel more at ease.

0/0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
1/1	My family is all vaccinated and doing great! CDC, thanks for the science and the leadership
1/1	My family is fully vaccinated. Including seniors, thank God they are all okay and nothing bad ever happened to them after getting the vaccine. I will have my second dose in a week. 😊 I am sharing my experience that bad reactions from the vaccine do not happen to everyone. I am happy with my choice and respect others who choose not to do the same because they are worried with their health.
1/1	My family is vaccinated
0/0	My family member died from the Covid vaccine
1/1/1	My family member was hesitant about signing up for their AstraZeneca shot but I showed them this video and now they feel much more comfortable!
0/0	My family was at that protest and that clip doesnt even nearly show how many people were actually there. They just don't want you to know and to think only a couple of people r againt the illegal COVID crap.
0/0	My family who got vaccinated started having horrible health problems, and infertility. They have also had Covid more times
0/0/0	My family will never take this poison
0/0/0	My father also got a racing heart some weeks after vaccine, woke up at nights and was having panic and so on
0/0	My father developed pericarditis right after his second mRNA dose. It wrecked his heart, leading to severe POTS issues for 18 months, and he eventually passed from a sudden cardiac arrest. The kicker was my employer denied my exemption after I shared my dad’s story and they fired me for not getting it. These people belong in jail.
0/0	My father died from a heart attack after Covid 19 jabs and boosters were performed on him mandatory
0/0/0/0	My father died from a heart attack after Covid 19 shots and boosters were performed on him mandatory

1/1	My father had covid shot and 2 other vaccines he had only nausea.
1/1	My father, my spouse, and I received it with no issues, waiting for my family physician to get a dose for my toddler and then we'll all have it
0/0	My fiance had such a bad reaction he ended up in the hospital after his second shot. U can't convince me to get it when I've seen first hand the horrible side effects
1/1	My first Pfizer shot I had no sore arm, only side effect at all was I was hyperactive, in other words, my heart for about 4 hours was in 7th gear, I had no chest pains or any other signs of illness. I had my shot 3 days ago, we get the second dose on the 14th day after my first one.
0/-1	My first question is what’s in it? I want the insert please. Then I’ll decide if I get it. My body - my choice.
0	My friend came to see me in March back then, he was getting a booster shot the next day, I begged him not to. He was 59. Anyhow, a few weeks go by and I hadn't heard from him, so sent off a text. His wife texted me back from his phone, he had a heart attack and died the day after the shot. Another friend who worked in care got both shots, and all the boosters. She got kidney cancer and died last year after a short battle. She was 41. Another friend got both shots and ever since has been like he had a stroke, even though they tell him he didn't. He just had to have his heart boosted to set his ticker right. He's 59 and was a super fit, gym going guy. A girl at my old job, well her dad suffered the same stroke like attack as my mate did. Her dad is in his 60's and will never be the same again. These aren't stories I heard on the grapevine. These are people I know. People who were all fine until the jab. I never took any of it and am perfectly fine. I'm sure I'm not the only one who knows at least one or two people who have died after it or will never be the same again.
0/0	My friend could not swallow after vaccine and landed up in the hospital. Another friends mom died. My sister landed up with shingles

0/0	My friend had a bad reaction. No thanks.
0/-1	My friend had a fever for several days after getting vaccinated. Is that supposed to be normal?
1/1	My friend had to get the C19 vaccine for a job. He said 3 days after it he tested positive for C19. I said that means you already had C19 for the past 2 weeks. He was still sure it was the vaccine. Then I told him the MMR vaccine doesnt inject you with the live virus, unlike other vaccines. brbrHe had nothing to say after that.
0/0	My friend has a Bruice like wtf one had a Really bad blood clump
0/0	My friend has been having seizures since she got it, she called me crying because she can’t work anymore because of the risk of falling in the workplace. The truth will come out about this shot just wait for it

0/0	My friend just died shortly from blood clots near her heart after being vaccinated; my aunt is slowly dying from blood clots on her lungs. She was healthy before taking the vaccine. The rest of the family who didn't take the jab are in excellent health.
1/0	My friend made fun of me for wearing a mask and my fear about covid. He got covid including his family. He got cured but His father died. His whole family under depression for months. Now they started again being ignorant. There is no cure for stupidity

1/1	My god it's almost like antivaxxers are idiots.
0/0	My godson, in his 20s and at no risk of serious harm from CoViD, was forced to take the shot, and has never been quite well since. He was recently hospitalized with suspected TB. There has, I have read, been a rise in TB since the CoViD shots came out.

0/0	My goodness I hope nobody is vaccinating their kids anymore
1/1	My grand parents, took the vaccines but to avoid letting them get more exposer to the virus it's important that as many people as possible get vaccinated.
1/1	My grandfather had polio. I'm grateful for vaccines.
0/0	My grandfather was diagnosed with blood cancer right after taking the 3 dose, my aunt said she couldn't wait to get the 3 shot.. She got a stroke 3 days later, and dont forget that so many young girls suddenly loose their period, my other aunt never had trouble with any health issues suddenly gets asthma. It doesn't seem right 🥺
0/0	My grandma died of covid after taking the vaccine, useless.

1/1	My grandma got it, my mom got it, I got it. We all fine. No superpowers tho, kinda disappointed.
0/0	My grandma got the vaccine and now she has heart problems. Coincidence? I think not
1/1	My grandma survived COVID because she was fully vaccinated. Vaccines are really useful.

1/1	My gym is open again, and I feel comfortable working out because people are vaccinated!
0/0	My health care provider advised me against getting any vaccines. All hush hush of course of the record conversation doesn't want to loose his well paying job
0/0	My healthy 80 yr old dad took the vax. He will never be the same. Strokes, etc.
0/0	My heart goes out to all who suffered vaccine side effects, they have suffered alone in the dark because no one will listen to their stories, any criticism about the vaccine is shunned in today's society
0/0	My heart goes out to the population that decided(for what ever reason )to get covid 19 vaccine.
1/1	My hospital always mandated flu vaccines. In medical school decades ago, we had to show our vaccine records or get revaccinated and we all received the new Hep B vaccine.
1/1	My household of 3 adults gets the vaccine every year. I am not interested in getting COVID.
1/1	My husband and I have had as many vaccines as we're eligible for (he has MM) and as far as we know, we haven't had Covid. And no side effects either.
1/1	My husband and I then got COVID when he was 13 months old, and literally all he got were some green boogers! He has gotten boosters as they’ve become available and we have had very good experiences. We’re coming out of it now. But the US has been experiencing a tripledemic every winter of flu, COVID, and RSV, so every bit of prevention you can do to keep the little babes out of the hospital is so helpful!
1/1	My husband and I, both 68, took both vaccines and had no problem at all... I even helped on Valentine's Day at my daughter's flower shop. I had to get the second vaccine then.... I went right back to work and I never was sore or tired.
0/0	My husband had all the 3 vaccines,but I refused to take any and to be frank nd sincere am healthier than he is.
1/0	My husband has nerve damage from his first vaccine. After we both got covid he says he would rather get the second shot and deal with the reaction
0/0/0/0	My husband nearly died of a massive heart attack after his second shot, both our moms and my aunt had strokes, our best friend died from a heart attack, my brother in law developed AFIB, I developed severe neuropathy and people in our neighborhood have also suffered adverse affects like these...everywhere we go, or random people we meet, or aquaintences all say the same things. This is no joke! Shame on them for crimes to humanity!!!
1/1	My husband, son and I all got boosted last October. I got covid in June, and was very mildly sick for 2 days, my husband got it the worst and was sick for 3 days, my son never got it. My unvaccinated sister got it and was sick for 3 weeks. I'll keep getting the shot every year. It's totally worth it for me.
1/1	My husband, son, and I got Movavax last month!
1/1	My immune system got better shortly after getting vaccinated. Also u need to also tell the whole story as the vaccine protects and the immune system comes back stronger with the vaccine.

0/0	My immune system has worked just fine my whole life. I don’t need Big Pharma’s poison.

0/0	My job already sent out an email, the vaccine will be available to us at the end of December. I am not taking any vaccine
1/1	My job has me interacting with lots of older people, people with weaker immune systems, etc. So yeah, I still get them, contrary to the “Covid vaccines are only for the scared” folks, I actually care about my customers, and my wife who has a weakened immune system, and my 4 year old daughter.
1/1	My kid got the covid vaccine and he’s fine
1/1	My kid got vaccinated and he’s still smarter than half the adults in this comment section.
1/1	My kid has been getting them since they first became available, and just got the updated booster a couple of months ago, so total 3 or 4. Zero side effects, healthy kid. Never gotten Covid. Edit: love the downvotes from antivax idiots ??
1/1	My kid is 2 and has had 2 Covid shots. Cried a little, but then took the bandaids off before we left the room (we did shots before the pediatrician came in). Nothing more than that for side effects either.
1/1	My kids are vaccinated, and I feel so much better about school safety.
1/1	My kids are vaccinated, and I have peace of mind knowing they’re protected.
1/1	My kids got vaccinated, and now I don’t worry as much when they go to school.
0/0	My kids have never gotten flu vaccines and they won’t get the co vid vaccine either and neither will I
0/0	My life's 100% from God's hand and 0% from your vaccine, stop your businesses on us.
1/1	My little girl got her 6 month vaccines, flu and covid all in one go. She did great and we have zero regrets! I trust science and got all of the covid boosters myself.

1/1	My medically qualified Doctor: "Vaccines are safe, and save lives"
1/1	My mom (75), my partner and i (42) all got the pfizer. Tired the day after but that was it.
1/1	My mom (unvaccinated) is blaming her bleeding on me (vaccinated) and saying that I'm shedding even though I've explained that it's literally impossible with an mRNA vaccine and even linked an article about it off the CDC's website but is still giving me a hard time... Sigh.
0/0	My mom and I got three shots. The third shot I was fine but my mom got a blood clot in her foot. The ER didn’t believe her until she forced them to do a scan. They had to go in and get rid of the clot because my mom had already had a heart attack from getting the virus. They tell you to get it if you’re immune compromised or otherwise weak against illnesses, but the same thing that’s supposed to protect you can easily kill you. We’re taking our chances now. No more of these vaccines. The ones uses for years and well studied are fine, the new ones coming out with all of these issues though? We’ll be thinking twice before trying that again. Stop using people as guinea pigs. My mom and I got lucky we didn’t die. Not everyone is so lucky.

0/-1	My mom had her 1st shot. She has a mild case of Parkinsons. The second morning her body froze completely for an hour. She's 85. That sensation dissipated over a week and was not as bad after the 1st episode. It was scarey.
1/1	My mom had the vaccine and she recently got Covid but it kept her from getting on the ventilator!
0/0/0	My mom had two brain aneurisms after her shots and died soon after !!!
1/1	My mom had vaccine. She is hypertensive, has a heart problem and is a chronic diabetic. When she got the virus, she had running nose for one day. My brother and his wife got the virus, were very ill, got hospitalised for two weeks, and had to take oral steroids for another week. They hadn't taken the vaccine So get the vaccine. Any vaccine is better than no vaccine.
1/1	My mom has health issues, so getting vaccinated wasn’t even a question. Gotta protect the ones we love.

0/0	My mother got vaccinated but still died. From now on, I won't trust any vaccines.
0/0	My mother had her 4th(!) jab on Wednesday and again, she’s completely lost her voice. It happened after her first one and has kept happening since. She didn’t believe it was to do with the jab until this time. It’s ridiculous. Her and my brother who have both had jabs and all the boosters have been non stop ill…
1/1	My mother has been very anti-covid vaccine because "they rushed the process" and "they can't even make a vaccine for the common cold". We've been bickering over it for months, and I plan to show her this video tommorow. Hopefully she'll change her stance, but even if she doesn't at least she'll be making an informed decision. Wish me luck Update: She didn't really care, and it doesn't seem to have changed much.
0/0	My mother has had cardiac episodes ever since she was jabbed. Two of her friends died shortly after and one is now paralyzed.

0/0/0/0	My mother was healthy with mild arthritis before the "vaccine". After the vaccine and the subsequent booster shots she developed pneumonia Parkinson's severe rashes and full-blown arthritis!!! She was a strong healthy woman now 3 years later she is wheelchair-bound in a nursing home!!!
0/0	My mother was perfectly healthy before Covid. She became sick after the vaccine-died four months ago of a pulmonary embolism.
0/0	My mum had a knee replacement on both knees in 2022 and the nurses asked her if she had received the covid vaccine, and my mother said no, and the nurse whispered "a lot of us haven't had it either
0/0	My mum had multiple strokes after her jab. I was forced to take it or wouldn’t have been allowed back to work (theatre). My brother refused to have it. He’s the sensible one!
1/1	My mum has a childhood friend whose parents decided not to vaccinate her against polio, and shure enough, she got polio as a result of being unvaccinated. Now, she lives in a wheelchair, something that was completely avoidable.
0/-1	My nan has put herself forward to be tested on for this... crazy woman
0/1	My neighbor refuses to get vaccinated because a Facebook page says that it will effect her DNA. There's stupid under every rock you turn over.
1/1	My newborns (twins) received 6 vaccines in two shots and will again in two months. Thanks to that we as a society are not flooded by disease and dead like we used to in previous centuries.
0/0	My niece has seizures after the injections. She fell for the lie.
1/1	My nursing and allied health students, who are learning about vaccines via distance learning in my online virtual classroom, are very grateful for this fantastic video. Well done, TedEd! Also.... VACCINATE YOUR KIDS, PEOPLE! Nurse TCI says so.
1/-1	My official position on vaccines: -I'm not 'anti-vax'. It doesn't seem to cause immediate harm. My immunocompromised father got it (The Pfizer one. Doctor's orders) He's fine. -Federal coercion is tyranny. -Citizens have the right to weigh their risk and choose if they need it.
1/1	My oldest brother had covid and now his heart is at 27% function. My dad still refuses to get the vaccine..
0/0	My only question (already had the vaccine) would be did they include people with, say Lupus, hypertension AND diabetes in the test group. And what is the reason for R arm epitrochlear node swelling to the size of a walnut? I'll save the "why can't I walk this morning without extreme pain" questions for later. :)
1/1	My otherwise healthy nine year old son is in the hospital with COVID pneumonia. Protect our children. Get vaccinated.
1/1	My own opinions: 1) The JnJ Covid vaccine is a good vaccine that provides durable protection, 2) it got voted off the island prematurely, 3) also it was done in a way to damage the reputation of the adenovirus vectored vaccines for other diseases, without adequate justification
1/0/0	My parents (who are very right leaning) got the vaccine before it was required by either of their jobs. They started being "anti Vax" once they realised the vaccine wouldn't be the end of masks, social distancing, online schooling, etc.
1/1	My parents 75/80 got their first shot of #moderna today and I'm so grateful. ?
1/-1	My parents and I got the first dosage in mid January of 2021. Two months later, after getting the second dosage, it was back to hugging, kissing and having guests over at our homes.
1/1/1	My parents and grandparents are all vaccinated now!
1/0/0	My parents didn’t want me to have vaccinations since I was 2. I am now 19 and went to get vaccines due to going into nursing. They told me if I had any worries they would work with an allergist to make sure I wouldn’t have a reaction. Simply talk to your doctor instead of believing they are secretly harming you.
1/1	My parents got their shots too! Feeling so relieved!
1/1	My parents got vaccinated, I got vaccinated, and we’re all fine. If this helps prevent severe illness, why not? 😊

0/0	My parents, brother and sister in law all got their shots and got sick anyway, so it really removed all doubt for me about my choice anyway. Just seemed like a grift to make Pfizer and their shareholders in congress a ton of $$$ - glad I did not partake and don’t regret not getting them at all.
0/0	My partner and i both chose not to take the vaccine.
1/1	My personal thoughts on the Covid-19 vaccines are simple: I got my first shot on the first day I was eligible. I got my booster on the first day I was eligible. I think the vaccines are arguably the greatest scientific achievement of the 21st century.
1/-1	My position on the 'vaccine' is that I am not against vaccination in principle. I think this vaccination has been rushed, though. It's not signed off. You can see that Govt might want to protect the population, but caution is dictated. People must be asked about clotting history.
1/1	My preschoolers will be getting vaccinated as soon as possible. Just like we were. Hopefully later this year.
0	My question is are anti vaxxers refusing to accept transplants from people who've been vaccinated? If not they are hypocrites
0/-1	My question is why do you care if somebody is anti-VAX? It doesn’t stop the spread and that is fact.
1/1	My relatives aren’t vaxxed. One of them is in otherwise amazing shape but since covid gets sick very often and has had a cough for a year.
0/0	My religion forbids vaccines. Respect my beliefs.

0/0	My sister developed this two weeks after the second shot and now she's on corticosteroids for life. Only 45 years old.
0/0/0	My sister died at 35 after the 2nd Pfizer shot due to a heart attack induced by blood clots. Her and tons of people like her aren’t here anymore because they trust led the government, media, and corrupt medical industry.
1/1	My sister had a reaction to a vaccine and can't get certain ones. She's still pro-vaccine.
0/0	My sister had the vaccine. She had to get blood work done shortly after and they couldn't get any blood. They said her blood was really thick.
0/0	My sister has passed away (not because of Covid) so i don’t like to talk about her negatively. But, she was threatening that I couldn’t stay and to move out if I didn’t have the vaccine. And that’s all because of the lies and rubbish we were fed, she was sadly gullible despite my attempts to convince her otherwise
0/-1	My sister in law, got vaccine then got covid and took her 3 months to recover. Then after feeling better, she went a head and got 2nd dose. Everything went down hill after. Got fluid in the lungs and heart after that even with drainage does not go away. Sadly, she passed away last Tuesday. So was it the vaccine or the virus?
0/0	My sister in-law , an RN, died after getting REQUIRED TO WORK shot.
1/1	My sister is a nurse and works in an ER in a place that has been a Covid hotspot for most of the pandemic and says now the only people coming in with severe/deadly Covid cases are unvaxxed, so PLEASE get vaxxed if you haven’t because it literally will save you even if you do get a breakthrough case!
0/0	My sister is going through horrific symptoms after taking the covid vax.
1/0	My sister still refuses to get vaccinated. Her belief “ Why should I get vaccinated to protect other people? No other vaccine works that way!” She unfortunately a teacher of elementary students. Sadly her teenage boys refuse to get vaccinated also due to her influence.
1/0	My sister was admitted to the hospital for cancer surgery. She is a veteran and works a job on Ft. Belvoir where she has to handle the public but was vaccinated. She spent from 9pm to 2am the next day in the hall on a gurney because the room she would have been assigned to was now lodging patients who were anti vaxxers but had caught COVID and needed care. If there concern is liberty and personal freedom fine. Let them be the ones in the hall on the gurney and not my sister or any patient who cared enough to protect themselves and others by being vaccinated.
1/1	My sister was born immune compromised, so I signed up the day the vax eligibility let me. I'm not going to war, but I'm looking out for our family.
1/1	My sister was tired and had head aches, but my aunt and uncle had it really hard. They said this was hard I don’t want to imagine the real deal.. so glad we all get vaxed
0/0	My sister, who is a front line healthcare worker, received the vaccine yesterday and then miscarried today after an uncomplicated pregnancy! #abortcovidvaccine
1	My son and I got our vaccine together when he was 6 months I think? I’m so glad we did too.
0/0	My son felt "forced" to get it from Ohio State University because they sent him emails every day. 9 days later after his Pfizer shot he had his first seizure. Now at 25 years old he is epileptic, and his life has been turned upside down.
1/1	My son gets whatever super soldier serum the doctor orders at each appointment, and has never had any reaction other than being tired/cuddly afterward! You got this!
0/0	My son got ITP thrombocytopenia. Within two weeks of his pfizer booster. On admittance to hospital his platelet count was 4,000, thats life threatening. He spent two weeks in the hospital getting courses of IV platelets, no help. Finally splenectomy. Still taking Steroids to keep immune response down, but last platelet count was 139,000. This mRNA vaccine needs further studies done and honest data collection on how many deaths and side effects are really happening. From what I am hearing and seeing there seems to be a suppression of the data being collected.
0/0	My son got this after his second vax, has lost his feeling in his left arm , left hand, and his fingers, no medical support to this very day, he has done his own rehabilitation and recovered 60 percent of his movement, it would be so helpful if you could list the names of doctors in each state that the American people could gets real treatment !
1/1	My son is almost 2 years old. He got vaccinated when he was around 7 months old. He has since gotten boosters. We got COVID about a month after his original vaccine and he bounced back so quickly!
1/1	My son is almost 2 years old. He got vaccinated when he was around 7 months old. He has since gotten boosters. We got COVID about a month after his original vaccine and he bounced back so quickly! He was the healthiest one in the house. When my daughter is old enough to get the vaccine, she will be getting it too. I had COVID before the vaccine came out and it took me over a year to recover. I would do anything possible to prevent my kids from going through that. So as the mom of a thriving 2 year old, I want you to know that our experience was completely routine, nothing bad happened when he got his original vaccine and nothing happened when he got boosters.
0/0	My son is in the army was forced to take the covid vaccine and others before he deployed to Germany to support Ukrainian soldiers returning from combat and he's been suffering different ailments since he returned a year ago and he was a college athlete was in tremendous health

0/0/0/0/0	My son's friend dropped dead after taking this! He was 16! Sudden unexplained death!
1/1	My son-in-law works as an air flow control engineer in hospitals He just got vaccinated and he's fine. When I can, I'm getting one. I'm a 72 year old retired school teacher and I'm DISGUSTED with the way teachers are acting. They all need to get vaccinated mask up and shut the hell up!!!
1/1	My students can't get vaccinated yet, so I did it to help protect them. Kids deserve a safe environment, and this is one way I can help
1/1	My symptoms were mild thanks to being vaccinated—best decision ever.
0/-1	My teacher had stroke symptoms as well but it wasn’t as drastic as what your friend went through
1/1	My thought as the fellow owner of a toddler is that 37% is way, way better than nothing. If someone gave me two pills and the option to choose one to take to prevent an illness, and one was 0% effective and one was 37% effective, I know it wouldn't be a question of which one to take. Anecdotally, my son had Moderna in July. He had zero side effects and I feel better knowing he is even slightly more protected.
1/0	My thoughts on COVID19 vaccination... 1. ALL these vaccines are experimental. Not enough data exists to finalize a profile on them. It is important to note they were pushed into use by the desperation of the situation, not their proven efficacy. Make a choice. For me: VACCINATE
1/1	My toddler had the Covid vaccine. She had no issue with it. A few months later, she then had a mild Covid infection right before she got a second terrible cold from a different virus that nearly killed her. She was on oxygen for days at the hospital. Getting the Covid vaccine could have saved her life, because no one knows if she would have been able to have fought off the perilous cold of unknown origin plus a worse Covid infection than the one she had. The science behind the Covid vaccine is not new. I’d urge everyone to vaccinate their children
1/1	My two cents: Get vaxxed. I honestly don’t care which one. I’d have taken Sinovac if that’s the only thing available. There’s a chance of a booster later. And it’s more than likely we’ll be getting COVID-19 vaccines like the flu vaccines — annually. Just get vaxxed.
0/0	My two elderly family members didn't get vaccinated because of mobility issues. Turns out, they recovered the fastest—just two days.
1/0	My uncle died of Covid. He had CF and a double lung transplant. His anti rejection medication kept him from being vaccinated. He was who we were trying to protect
1/1/1/1/1	My uncle died of Covid. He had CF and a double lung transplant. His anti rejection medication kept him from being vaccinated. He was who we were trying to protect.
0/0	My uncle got cardiac arrest not long after he had his shot. I know lots of females who got trouble menstruating after covid vaccine.
0/0	My uncle got vaccinated and had heart problems after. But let’s ignore that, right?
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	My uncle had a heart attack 1 week after getting the Pfizer vaccine, lucky he survived, but is in constant pain. My aunt also started having uncontrollable shaking and tremors.
0/0	My uncle took shots then right after an additional booster died from a heart attack
0/0	My understanding is RFK JR is not anti-vax, he is anti-unsafe vaccines (like the mRNA). He believes vaccines should be tested to a higher standard.
0/0	My unvaccinated friends got COVID once and moved on. Meanwhile, I took every shotttttt and keep getting sick :( :( :((((((( What’s going on????????????
1/1	My vaccine experience was smooth, and I’m happy I made the decision to get it.

1/1/0	My vaccine is working out and dieting 💪💪💪
1/1	My vaccine-hesitant parent decided to get the vaccine after their local county announced it was implementing a vaccine mandate for indoor dining. Not the multitude of other reasons I hounded them about long before that. Whatever, I'll take it!!

1/1	My wife and I both got the COVID vaccine as soon as we could. She went to a white area close to our home and got Pfizer. I went to an economically depressed minority area and got Johnson & Johnson.
1/1	My wife and I both got the COVID vaccine as soon as we could. She went to a white area close to our home and got Pfizer. I went to an economically depressed minority area and got Johnson & Johnson. I have no problem at all with anything that is said in this video but the looks of it are horrible. If I lived in that Minority area I would be very slow to get the vaccine. My feeling would be if J & J's so great then send it over to the white area of town and send me Pfizer.
1/1	My wife and I have received every vax recommended. In August, for the first time, we both developed COVID. I had the sniffles and a cough. She had a bad headache and heavy congestion as well as well as a cough. I was ill for about 4 days, her for 6. We waited to get out next vaccine (Moderna) until last week. Interestingly, neither one of us had an immune response likewe had previous vaccinations, chills, headache, malaise. We felt perfectly fine the next day.
1/1	My wife and I haven’t missed a single Covid shot since their introduction (at appropriate intervals, now yearly — as we’re just in our mid-50’s, and aren’t immunocompromised).
1/1/1/1	My wife and I last went through Covid about a year ago. I'm not vaxxed and felt shitty for about 10 days, and my double vaxxed wife felt shitty for about 10 days. The difference is my wife has a lot of health problems and without the vaccine, I don't know if she'd still be here.
1/1	My wife and i both are vaccinated and always wear a mask
1/1	My wife didn't get the vaccine either, she said she don't know what effects can come from it, i went through our medicine cabinet and she has quite a few prescriptions and each contain a lot of different ingredients, i said did you go through each one of them and go over each substance that was in it? she said no, i said why not? she said because i didnt thats why.
0/0	My wife had a very low level of asthma almost undetectable. Then she got her Pfizer shot and she started feeling short of breath on the way to the car. That night, her asthma got so bad that she nearly seized up, couldn't breathe. I had to take her to the emergency room. Neither the pulmonologist nor allergist could figure out what happened. Official sources will claim this is just a random anecdote, but this has happened to many hundreds of people. Offcial sources are not to be trusted
0/0	My wife saying people at her job [vaxxed] getting cold/flu symptoms continuously.
0/0/0	My wife was fired from GBMC Hospital as a nurse for not getting this poison while pregnant and breast feeding. I look forward to the outcome of this lawsuit.
0/0	My wife was in the hospital and almost died cause of this vaccine
1/1	My wife wasn't vaccinated as a child because she had reactions, now as an adult she's going to need get about 7 or so shots because she did not get them as a kid. I really do not feel comfortable with the idea of parents endangering their children and other people just because they simply do not understand how these things work. My wife had reactions sure, but that's because you're being given a version of the disease weak enough that your body can create the antibodies for it. Hence why people who have gotten Covid are being told they don't generally need the vaccine, keyword generally.
1/1	My wife, my daughter and I (M59) have all been getting the shots. None of us has gotten Covid.
0/1	My wife’s aunt was anti vaccine. She pretended like she got it and everything (she’s also a nurse) then she got covid and swore she was dying. Now she’s gonna get the vaccine but she’s still against it “because reasons” but she just “doesn’t want to die” like bitch pick a lane.
1/1	My wife’s in healthcare and everyone there gets it. My family of 4 get flu and Covid booster every year. Sore arm is always the worst of it. The internet is full of echo chambers and anecdotes propped up by conformation bias, that’s why we have the scientific method, to cut through the thousands of unverified claims, gut feelings and personal biases. Don’t ask a random anonymous group on the internet what to do with your health. Talk to your pharmacist and/or doctor about your concerns. If you are high risk you should get it.
1/1	My workplace requires vaccines, and I fully support the policy.
1/1	My youth football team all received five sensible injections in March. And it’s no coincidence we play for the championship this week. That’s why I’m a youth football coaching legend, not some random clown
1/-1	Myocarditis chance when taking vaccine is 0.01%

0/0	Nah, I've had the jabs and still got COVID 2x so what is the point exactly?
0/-1	Nah, I’m good. So, it’s been 2years later. Make a update video on your health. Either you didn’t get the clot shot, or, you may just barely be clinging to life now… lol
0/0	Nah, but I didn’t get the first one. I haven’t ever gotten a flu shot though either. I wasn’t so much against ever getting the shot, but I wanted to see how everything went with the shots were first rolled out. I’ve had a confirmed Covid case once and a few other times of being sick that were probably Covid. It’s never been a big deal.

0/0	Never gonna take the 666 , never! I rather die and float to heaven by God's grace.
0/0	Never got Covid until I got two Moderna vaccines back in 2021. Ever since I got the shot, I have debilitating fatigue, shortness of breath, vertigo, sleep problems, I was told by superiors to do the right thing and I did and now have so many side effects. No point in bringing up these concerns to a drs office because all they will tell you “ we just don’t know it’s just so new”. Most frustrating thing is I was an athlete and now can’t even walk to the next room across me as I’m so exhausted. I’m 19.
0/0	Never got a vaccine, people said I was mental, I said no I’m not.
0/0	Never got any myself. I did get covid in '21 though, wasn't that bad.

0/0	Never got the vaccine and that includes my husband and 3 adult children and my grandson! We also never bought into the testing either! We are all alive and well
1/0	Never had a covid shot had covid 4 times each time with less severity. Last time was just a little cough and sinuses for about 4 days.
0/0	Never had a flu Jab and never had a COVID jab. Never will. Nor will my children. No wonder so many people are sicker than ever
0/0	Never had a vaccination jab, never will,🎉
0/0	Never had the jab
0/0	Never had the vaccines, caught it twice the first time was pretty rough in all honesty. Steamed with oregano oil, wow that stuff is powerful and completely killed it off and meant I didn't lose my sense of smell and taste. Family members who did have the vaccines have been unwell since
0/0	Never heard so much naievity. Like lambs to the slaughter.
1/1	Never in my wildest imagination would I have thought that a deadly virus could target a certain mindset....lol
0/0/0/0	Never take nothing that comes out too fast. No way something that comes out too fast i will not run to it. Do your research first b4 making a decision.

0/0	Never vaxxed, never locked-down, never masked, never tested, never bowing
0/0	Never will take that poison shot. I feel bad for the ones who have taken it. Most everyone I know who took it has health problems now. Some are still blind and think it wasn't the poison shot that did it to them.
0/0	Never wore a mask, never took the shot and never got Covid or bird flu. No Myocarditis, no blood clots, no turbo Cancers. Trust your own immunity.
0/0	Never. It's not a regular vaccine, it's a gene injection.
0/0	Nevermind that 99.97% survive on their own natural immunity. Reading comments on this site is like listening to the sounds from a sheep 🐑 pen.
1/1	New evidence confirms COVID-19 vaccines are overwhelmingly safe.

0/-1	News from Brazil, unfortunately sinovac ia not being very good for elderly case. Before they told that people over 60 yrs would have 100% eficiency. But now proves zero to 25%...
1/-1	News reports say that many schools arranged vaccinations for teachers and students before the new semester started.
1/1	News reports show that infection and severe illness rates have significantly declined after vaccination, which proves its effectiveness.
1/1	Next time I'm sick I'm just going to go to an anti-vaccine rally and sneeze
1/1	Ngl I’ve felt great since I got fully vaxxed nearly two months ago whole family vaxxed we just enjoy life again
1/1	Nice
0/0	Nice I was forced to have it now my immune system has been wiped out
0/0	Nice of you to remove comments that lead people to the TRUTH. Who remembers when we were talking about the side effects they called us dangerous "conspiracy theorists“??
1/1	Nice to know how this stuff is working around and how it came to be! Thanks to all the doctors, researchers, and essential workers who made this possible
0/0	Nice video, but you can not make the same study for the Covid vaccin from Pfizer because it was developed in a rush so there is no reliable information about long term side effects. And what’s more, most of the cases with side effects are covered up by the government! To much money involved! That is also why Ursula Von Der Leyen does not make her emails with Pfizer public! If you look at this video it looks as if all vaccins are perfectly safe, and most of them are, but they were tested over a period of 10 years for side effects! The Pfizer vaccin is only tested over a period of 1 year so long term effects did no occur. So this video is only half truth.
1/-1	Nice. 7 minutes of video, posted 1 minutes ago, yet there are people already saying "no" with absolutely no extra info
0/-1	No
1/1/1	No AntiVax here because… look where you are it’s VOX only reasonable people who want to learn the science get here.
0/-1	No Bill Gates vaccine for me!!
0/0	No Covid shot. No mask. No social distancing. Never missed a day at the office.
0/0	No I don't trust it not that I don't trust the science it's just the vaccine was developed way too fast so I don't know what the side effects are or what kind of reactions I could have to it I will continue to mask and social distance
0/0	No I won't! No gene editing for me thanks anyway!
0/0/0	No I wont, because I never got the 1st dose to begin with. Nor would or will I ever.
0/0	No KILL JAB FOR ME!!

0/-1	No hope. No hope of getting all those things whatsoever. You obviously think you are the only person on this planet and you owe nobody else nothing. Doesn't work that way.
0/0	No if you become paralyzed after vaccinated. Problem is you don't know if you are or not and you don't know if you will contract covid or not
0/0	No is the answer
1/1	No issues for me. Happy to be up to date.
1/1	No issues. No one in my family or friends that i know of had any real issues except a couple who got shingles not long after the vaxx, my parents still haven't even had covid.
1/-1	No it did have 90% efficacy (not efficiency). They di know that the vaccine was 90% effective in preventing symptomatic covid19. What evidence do you have to back up your claims?
1/0	No it's not like getting COVID at all. It is just mimicking a covid-19 spike protein on your existing cells but with no ability to self replicate or mutate like the whole pathogen. It is akin to showing someone how to recognise a dog by showing them a drawing of a dog, but not an actual dog. Obviously it's not as dangerous as the actual pathogen but nor would it elicit the same degree of immune response from the body.
0/0	No jab for me!

0/0	No one has ever regretted not getting vaccinated. I have certainly regretted getting mine
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	No one in our house got one single shot!! People treated us like sociopaths for not complying
1/0	No one is forcing you to get vaccinated, but don’t expect sympathy when you get sick and overwhelm hospitals. Actions have consequences. 💀
1/1	No one is forcing you to take the vaccine. What they are trying to do is encourage you.
1/-1	No one is reporting on how many cases of the flu or how many flu deaths or hospitalizations there are none of my people who have been sent out for testing have been tested for the flu why are they not keeping track of those numbers it’s ridiculous this fear mongering

0/0	No one knows the long-term effects. I feel safer relying on herbal remedies.

0/0	No one needs a vaccine from bill gates
0/0/0/0	No one regrets NOT getting jabbed. 💉
0/0	No one regrets not taking it
0/0	No one seems to talk about the fact that this is wholly experimental, that ALL vaccines up until this point were not RNA and that the side effects are as of yet UNKNONW. We are experimented on by this, presenting RNA vaccines as safe and acceptable is deceitful as well as accountable in my view, I hope that there are dependable sources that publicize this information :(
0/0	No one should be forced to take a vaccine against their will
0/-1	No one should be pressured to take medicine or vaccine they don’t want.
0/0	No one should have lost their jobs after refusing to have the vaccine!! Trump has honoured their original contracts of employment with the Government what a tremendous thing to do would anyone else have done this? I very much doubt it this just goes to show what a true Patriot Trump is and how much he values the services and commitments of the Soldiers of the USA!! Well done President Trump!!

0/0	No thanx- no evil injection for me!

0/0	No vaccine for me. My brother has been so sick and hospitalized several times from his (4) covid shots.
0/0	No vaccine for me. Propaganda news.
1/0	No vaccine guarantees immunity. We've all been vaccinated and still got symptoms (only 1 tested positive) while on the Encore this summer. You have to think of a vaccine like showing your army (immune system) a photo of the bad guys. Some bad guys may get through, but that extra intel should keep them from destroying your base and/or using it to attack other bases.
0/0	No vaccine here and never will be
1/1	No vaccine in history has been more tested than this one. It'll get FDA approval soon, too. I understand not trusting the government. But every government in the world lying about this vaccine is extremely unlikely. All evidence shows that being vaccinated greatly reduces your chances of getting the Delta variant and, if you do still get it, limits the damage caused by it.
0/1	No vaccine is 100% effective. There's no report so far that the COVID-19 vaccine can prevent transmission
1/1	No vaccine is perfect, but Covid vaccines are very effective at preventing infection and stunningly good at preventing serious illness if an infection does occur.
0/0	No vaccine no problem mate.

0/0	No way, no how will I ever submit to vaccination. NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	No way.
0/0	No way. Too risky.
0/0	No won't be taking any more COVID vaccinations. Got all the symptoms of long covid after my first dose. It made me as sick as a dog, especially with Pericarditis. Not to mention it also hugely increased my pain from my AS. One Rheumatologist in Australia said about 10% of people already on immune suppression had adverse reactions to it. Another Dr of mine with allot of chronically ill patients said she saw about 30%. It happened to quite a few people I know who have Autoimmune diseases too. The very same vacs we were told to wait to get. The ones recommended for at risk populations. I still wear a mask on the rare occasion I leave the house but no more quickly put together vaccines for me. Thanks all the same.
0/0	No wonder why heart attack is the common cause of death of those died after being vaccinated
1/-1	No worries about travel restrictions anymore!
0/0/0	No you do not . Naturally obtained immunity always works best.
0/0	No! Never going to do it! Can’t trust them
1/1	No, COVID-19 vaccines have not been linked to infertility or miscarriage.
0/0/0	No, I did not take the vaccine and I too, never caught COVID.
0/0	No, I had a very bad adverse reaction to the first shot
0/0	No, I had a very bad adverse reaction to the first shot. Not allowed to get any more.
0/-1	No, I think that's enough for now!
1/1	No, and religion shouldn't be a valid excuse to avoid vaccination because your faith shouldn't interfere with my right to not get ill! As a Christian myself, I believe that God and Jesus would encourage vaccination!
0/0	No, at least you’d be given chances to see if theres any long term side effects. This however, we don’t know as we don’t have long term side effect data yet.
0/0	No, but you do you.
0/0/0/0	No, definitely not. I will be keeping my social distance (1.5 metres) from any needle containing a vaccine from Pfizer.
0/-1	No, even though I went full mask for a long time, got fully vaccinated (4 shots) and limited contacts, I still caught Covid 3 times.
0/-1	No, felt kinda achey the next day but the day after I'm back to normal. Also I got multiple vaccines at the same appointment. For what it's worth, my arm hardly hurt at all, and I think my side effects (for Moderna) were less noticeable than previous versions.
0/0	No, no flu shot either.
0/0/0/0	No, the risks from covid do not outweigh the side effects of the vaccines.
0/0	No. Because have no desire to put an experimental drug in my body to protect me from a virus that has a 99.9% cure rate. Hopefully, you won’t experience long term issues. But as the vaccine has not been tested for the long term, we simply do not know.
1/1	No. Different COVID vaccines work on different principles but they all have one thing in common: they don't contain any live virus. So you don't have COVID when you get the vaccine and the vaccine can't develop into COVID. I do understand your confusion because there have been vaccines in the past (such as the MMR vaccine) that contain live (but weakened) forms of the virus that they're vaccinating against. But none of the COVID vaccines use this technique. By the way those sorts of vaccines are known as "live-attenuated vaccines" so that is the search term that you can use if you want to read further on the matter.
0/0	No. I feel like all three of the Covid vaccinations have been rushed. I want to hear about the side effects to the first people who have taken them. From the volunteers who did a trial with this I haven’t heard anything positive.
0	No. I feel like all three of the Covid vaccinations have been rushed. I want to hear about the side effects to the first people who have taken them. From the volunteers who did a trial with this, I haven’t heard anything positive
0/0	No. I'm pregnant & there have been no trials to include pregnant women. So I'm not risking my twin boys or myself.
0/0	No. The vaccinated are posing a risk to the unvaccinated dear.
0/0	No. This is discrimination to the max and illegal. Vaccinated ppl can spread Covid as well as anyone! Last time I looked it s a free country even tho Obiden is trying to take that from us.
0/0	No. Unless you are old are compromised in some way, I don't see any point. If I were 65 I would probably get an annual booster. I already have quite good cellular immunity from previous doses and infections. If I get it again (I'm sure I will get it again eventually whether I get a booster or not), I'm sure it will be extremely mild like it was last time.
1/1	Nobody cares. They should have gotten their vaccine months ago!
0/-1	Nobody forced me to get a flu shot. Why is this different? 🚫
1/-1	Nobody in his family died from covid when they didn't take any precautions, but he never thought that he could have gotten countless people sick that he doesn't know.
1/1	Nobody is getting heart attacks from this
1/0	Nobody is talking about if I myself should get the vaccine I know vaccines are good but should I wait shouldn't ppl at less risk wait to get it so there isn't a shortage and ppl at high risk can get it firat

0/0/0/0/0	Nope
0/0	Nope Baby Nope. It has been proven that the covid shot was not helpful. It did not prevent getting or spreading covid. It was never tested and will in the future be known as the vaccine that killed thousands and did great bodily harm to millions. We need RFK jr.
0/0	Nope I did my own research and fell into the conspiracy rabbit hole I don’t want to talk about it
0/0	Nope and I don't get flu shots either. Why is this generation obsessed with unnecessary medicine that's not even proven to work or match the active strains lol
0/0	Nope not enough testing and also too much info from some doctors about what else is potentially in the shot
0	Nope unless they mandate it. If they mandate it,all the ones saying they won't get it, what are you Gonna say wheh they say religious exemption is not counted? Whats your back up then?
0/0	Nope, I don’t do the Covid or the flu shots.
0/1	Nope, I hate shots I’m not getting pricked if I don’t have too.
0/0	Nope, natural immunity is ALWAYS better
0/0	Nope. I never had covid and I hardly ever get sick.
0/0	Nope. I’ve had covid a few times and it wasn’t severe enough to convince me to get the shot
1	Nope. Just saying that our immune systems have never encountered COVID-19 before and thus have a much harder time fighting it. The solution is vaccination.
0/0	Nope. No way.
0/0	Nope.. For some weird reason I never get sick so I stopped getting the flu shot years ago. Covid shot will also continue to skip.
0/0	Normal vaccines are ok, but this one is extremely scary. With a 1 to 800 ratio of severe side effects, the Pfizer vaccine is the only highly dangerous vaccine to remain in use for this long. Most side effects where reported from 12 weeks after the jab, sometimes people where doing fine and then one day they fall dead from heart failure. Scary stuff, basically don't ever trust the news, your government, mainstream media...
1/1	Normally I'd be all for placing part of the blame on people not getting vaccinated/boosted, but I can't this time. I live in a not-small college town and there are no covid vaccines to get. None of the pharmacies have them in stock, regardless of patient/customer age or health. They stopped buying and have just been waiting for the update, which I'm sure will be met with an initial rush and difficulty for everyone who wants to get.
1/1	Not a antivaxxer. Made the right choice to be fully vaccinated.
1/1	Not a fan of needles, but a big fan of science and the vaccine! Fingers crossed that the pressure starts to fade away for all the frontline heroes at our hospitals
1/1	Not a mom but I’m an aunt and a nanny and all the little ones I know are healthy and happy after getting it. I totally understand the anxiety but Covid is pretty miserable.
0/0/0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab…NOT ONE.
0/0	Not a single person in my whole family, nor any of my friends, believes in the COVID vaccine.
0/0/0	Not a single person on earth regrets not getting the vaccine. Half the people who got it say they regret it. Haha that’s all I need to know
0/0	Not a vaccine
0/0	Not according to the new reports you were court ordered to release. They’re not so safe. Natural immunity is best.
0/1	Not an anti vaxer but I haven't currently had the vaccine. What this video fails to address is that the trials for this vaccine aren't set to complete until January 2023. How many other vaccines or medications are released before the end of their trials?
1/1	Not anti vax morons in the comment section thinking passage of time justified their idiocy
1/0	Not anti vax, I just choose not to take them and I haven't been sick sense

0/0	Not anti-vax, just anti-experimental shots.
0/0	Not buying it!
0/0	Not enough long-term studies. I’ll pass.
1/1	Not even simple cartoons and simple explanations will help those who don’t want to get vaccinated.
1/1	Not everyone can be vaccinated safely. But everyone who can should—for the good of all.
1	Not everyone can get vaccinated, so the rest of us should.
1/1	Not false is true because vaccine protect you
0/0	Not for me and my family obviously. I’ll donate them to those desperate sheeple.
0/0	Not getting it - look up what happens to your DNA with these ingredients in these vaccines. I suggest biological research on why these vaccines have never been used before..
0/0	Not getting this! Will not CONSENT!
1/1	Not getting vaccinated because of Facebook conspiracy theories is a new level of stupidity.
0/-1	Not getting vaccinated is also an act of love
0/1	Not getting vaccinated is still more dangerous.

0/0	Not just kids...grown healthy adults...got all kinds of problems now ... unbelievable
0/0	Not me I'm not getting vaccinated no way I am glad I am getting a new job I need money for my bills.
0/0	Not me I’m not a lab rat I want to see the long term affect good or bad How long is it good for 1 week 1month 1 year ???
1/1	Not me, I’m fully vaccinated because I trust the science and for doing the right thing.
1/1	Not once. My partner, a home infusion nurse, has been exposed multiple times, has yet to get i
0/0	Not one unjabbed person regrets that decision!!!! You can't say that for the sheeple....
0/0	Not only is it tolerated, but it's given to healthy children and babies who are not even at risk.
0/-1	Not rare at all.
0/0	Not rare when so many people know someone who has been injured by these injections. I’m glad I never took it.
1/1	Not risking a severe covid case or bringing it to your loved one is a big pro.
1/1	Not risking a severe covid case or bringing it to your loved one is a big pro. There isn't really a con, except sometimes being midly unwell during 24-48h like with any other vaccines.
0/0	Not safe for everyone!
1/1	Not significantly as far as I'm aware. In raw numbers Moderna seems to be slightly more effective. Mixing and matching also seems to be beneficial. But it's not a game changer like the other commenter said. Also, it's less a "booster" now than it is just your seasonal COVID vaccine, like the flu shot.
1/1	Not so new News flash, we have longer life expectancies since the creation of vaccines. Case closed.
1/0	Not so rare anymore. Deaths skyrocket rare cancers everywhere strokes heart attacks. Wonder when you fools will wake the fawk up. These talking heads should be held accountable for their lies.
0/0	Not taking any of these experimental shots was the best decision I ever made
1/1	Not taking the vaccine because of a TikTok video is crazy.
0/0	Not taking this mess of a "safe" vaccine.
0/0/0/0	Not that I don't trust anybody.....it's just that I don't trust anybody!!!!!
0/-1	Not to mention 28 years old!
0/0	Not to sure I want that vaccine in my body either
0/0	Not true - your risk of dying of covid is not diminished by getting vaccinated nor keeping you from a severe infection - absolutely no difference to anybody not vaccinated
0/0	Not vaccinated and still hugged my friends and family this whole time… some of us were blessed with critical thinking
1/1	Not vaccinating your kids is a bigger risk than vaccinating them.
1/1	Not vaccinating yourself or your children not only puts you at risk, but also immunity-compromised individuals as well.
0/0	Not worth the risk. Let natural selection do its job. Only the strong will survive.
1/1	Note what he said at the beginning and the end: we were able to get to finished vaccine because of all the research into other coronavira over more than a decade. They did not start from scratch!
1/1	Nothing but gratitude for the amazing medical community!
0/0	Nothing happens, they keep asking I keep refusing. Ignore the guilt trip it is psychological manipulation.
1/-1	Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity. - Martin Luther King
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Nothing says 'Trust The Science" quite like "You can't sue us if something goes wrong" and "We need 55 years to release the data to the public"
0/0	Nothing says safe like an experimental vaccine developed in less than 4 months with no long-term studies for side effects.
1/1	Nothing terrible is going to happen to you because of the vaccines you already had. If they were going to cause problems, it would have already happened. Because you're young, and if you're a healthy person, covid is unlikely to cause you serious harm. It could happen, but it's less likely in young people.
1/1	Novavax isn't mRNA, just spike proteins. I tried it a couple months back and it didn't tire me out like previous mRNA Covid vaccines have.
0/0	Now Bill Gates wants to use his Ai Server Farm in Wisconsin to scrub all vaccine misinformation. His way to control the narritive. Who is to say the stop there. They will use it to scrub everything they don&#39;t want out there.
0/0	Now I don't understand why I should get vaccinated. I'm 65 plus, in good shape, good immune system, had mild Covid once, 0 shots taken.
0/0	Now I know why the CDC bought those disposable coffins for. They're stashed all over North America. Those who have taken it are gonna drop like crazy.
1/1	Now I’ll get the vaccine
1/1	Now THIS, is extremely important information! Thank you for sharing the statistics regarding breakthrough cases and hospitalizations! It gives me hope we can use this data to convey the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, currently vaccination rates are going up. Keep it up!
1/0	Now discuss the theories that childhood illnesses reduce the risk of cancer later in life because your immune system actually is supposed to be challenged from time to time. My nana raised her kids in the 30s and said “every child needs to eat a peck of dirt”… And let’s dive deeper into polio and the other diseases in the early 1900s that already had reduced from improved hygiene before the introduction of the vaccines… And no talk of the fact Big Harma is free from all liability and the millions our tax payer dollars have paid to vaccine injured children? What a disappointing conversation. I’m shocked at Dr. B.
1/-1	Now imagine one of the loudest antivaxxers in charge of the US health care system.
0/0	Now its confirmed the Covid vaccine increases your chances of a heart or neurological illness by 30%. Would love to see this guys views on vaccines now
0/0	Now only if they were brave enough to come out and say that COVID vaccines were a hoax
0/0	Now someone tell Florida, still getting emails from the department of health that the vaccines are dangerous and not recommended.
0/0	Now tell everyone how they can rid their bodies of this sketchy vaccine , if that can not be done then tell them where to send their lawyers for ruining their lives and the lives of their loved ones . This kind of lie will bring some serious karma to all those involved in this lie.
0/0	Now the “virus” will be spread easier/faster and the vulnerable will suffer the consequences... do people know they are getting aborted Fetal Cells injected?
0/-1	Now they’re saying “oops, maybe we got some things wrong.” bruh
1/-1	Now we know that reverse transcription actually does occur.
1/1	Now we need an mRNA vaccine against conspiracy theories.
0/1	Now you can stop your brainwashing and convince people about the vaccine!
0/0	No….in all the decades since the 50’s I have never taken a single vaccination. My parents believed them to be wrong then and nothing has happened to change my mind. Maybe that is why I am still fit and healthy into retirement
0/1	Nuremberg Code. ... #6. The risks should never exceed the benefits.
0/0	Nurse here. That worked on the COVID “front lines.” It was a scam. Easy way for hospitals/urgent cares/pop up sites to create EASY STUPID MONEY. Why did you think there were so many pop up sites? SO MUCH FUGGIN MONEY THAT YOU MADE IF YOU DEALT ANYTHING WITH COVID. Hospital Providers had meetings

1/1	Nurses are at the forefront of vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. They are undoing the work of doctors and scientists everywhere! Let’s do our part and force these anti Vaxx nurses from their professions. America needs stop defending nurses! An unvaccinated nurse is not essential!
0/0	När kommer det ett vaccin som är testad o visar att de funkar mot detta? För som de verkar nu, så gör inte detta vaccin någon skillnad alls.
0/1	OMG vaccine is getting ready
0/0/1	OPERATION WARP SPEED: President-elect Trump’s Operation Warp Speed — which encouraged the rapid development and authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine — was highly successful and helped save millions of lives. COVID-19 VACCINE: Contrary to what was promised, the COVID-19 vaccine did not stop the spread or transmission of the virus. RUSHED COVID-19 VACCINE APPROVAL: The FDA rushed approval of the COVID-19 vaccine in order to meet the Biden Administration’s arbitrary mandate timeline. Two leading FDA scientists warned their colleagues about the dangers of rushing the vaccine approval process and the likelihood of adverse events. They were ignored, and days later, the Biden Administration mandated the vaccine. This is the part that made me laugh. President Trump's Operation Warp Speed saved millions of lives but the vaccines it produced were rushed and unsafe?
0/0	Objectively, getting vaccinated was not the right choice. It’s long proven (and objective fact) that it did not stop transmission so there was no societal benefit.
0/0	Obvious big pharma ad.
0/0/0	Obviously not protected at all since they say you need multiple
0/0	Obviously she didn’t see the 2019 interview with Eco-Health Alliance Director Peter Daszak Dr. Fauci’s buddy he said in his interview that there was no vaccine that could be created that would stop the coronavirus. Recent history has proven his statement correct. 7
0/-1	Odd she never says how "rare" these effects are.
0/0	Of all the shocking medical scandals that have taken place over the last decades. This covid debacle is by far the most previous in so many ways. Apart from nuremburg this is the most serious and most subtly pernicious to our future trajectory sin against humanity
1/1	Of course I'm getting vaccinated and have had the first shot.
1/1	Of course I've been vaccinated. But then we need to think about how we can avoid pandemics in the future.
1/1	Of course some people might react badly especially when it's been created so fast, but this is to ensure that humanity as a whole can get through this pandemic
1/1	Of course vaccination, but I have a neighbor who got vaccinated and still got Corona...and is sick, so a little caution is still needed.
1/1	Of course we do! I got mine last month. Along with my flu vax and an hep vax. Vaccines are fantastic!
1/1	Of course we should all get vaccinated for all viruses that there are vaccines against, I had the measles one Christmas as a youngster and it wasn't fun so I'm for vaccines
1/1	Of course your not immune break through cases happen with any vaccine but you have a way better chance not to get covid if your vaccinated, And yes it you do have a break through case, The vaccine will help you get better faster and lessen the effects of the virus.
1/-1	Of course!
1/1	Of course! I got my second vaccination this week
1/1	Of course, vaccinated people can get sick as well. They just have lower chances of getting serious symptoms that leads to hospitalization. Thus, not overcrowding the hospitals for people who really need it.
1/1/1/1/1	Of course, vaccines are safe and effective.
1/1	Of course, vaccines save lives.
1/1	Of coursedose 1 taken, dose 2 at the beginning of June
1/1	Of the greatest ideas, this is one.
1	Officials repeatedly emphasize that vaccines have undergone multiple clinical trials, so there’s no need for excessive fear.
0/-1	Often, anti-vaccine viewpoints are widespread in social media.
0/0	Often, the cure is worse than the disease. In this case, that has turned out to be so true. What a mess. What a tragedy.
0/0	Oh a study has been allowed now. After 99% of the population has stopped taking it!
1/-1	Oh excuse me * You don't want the vaccine ? Ok can I have your place in line please ? 🤣
0/0	Oh gee...and I knew this years ago..never took that poison..
1/1	Oh hell yes. Whatever side effects you’ll get (unless you really have a bad allergy to the vaccine) is not even close to the benefits you and the people around you will get from you being vaccinated
0/0	Oh look guys all of a sudden there’s side effects!
0/0	Oh lord! I hate vaccinations and autism!
0/0	Oh no the first jab and second jab didn’t kill you??!!… let’s try a third shall we.
0/-1	Oh no, it's going to keeping mutating
1/0	Oh please people! The vaccine for Covid is just like most all other vaccines. It doesn't prevent the disease/ illness, it was and has always been described as being something that would lessen the effects and severity of the disease. Flu shots, pneumonia shots, shingles, etc etc. They don't prevent, they lessen the effects on you!
0/0	Oh so effective! Hahahaha
1/-1	Oh this bridge has a 0.000001% chance of collapsing with me on it guess I’ll just have to swim across instead
1/1	Oh wait....No it IS NOT FAKE!!!! If I could hug the inventors of the Covid Vaccine, let me tell you: I WOULD.
0/0	Oh yeah they worked so well
1/1/1	Oh yes millions dying globally is just one big scam…mama will sing a very different tune when it hits her own
1/0	Oh yes the naturalness bias. Because if it came straight from the earth it must be healthy right? On that note I have stopped drinking Mountain Dew and have switched to crude oil because that comes from the earth; it is natural.
1/-1	Oh, RFK is the man who is in charge of our health !?! we are cooked
1/1/0	Oh, so there’s a 0.0001% chance of side effects? Guess I’ll just take my chances with a deadly virus instead
0/0/0	Oh, the vaccines, that caused my neighbor to have convulsive episodes and shakes.
0/0	Oh, we DO still trust science. We just don't trust SCIENTISTS to always do what is right.
0/0/0	Ohh , you mean Faucci science. . Yeah, that's credible . Give me a break!
1/1	Ok I need help. So I'm going to try and secretly get the vaccine because my mom is antivax but I need it to get on my campus. If I get it but my siblings haven't gotten it does that put them at risk in any way?
1/1	Ok I’m thankful for this video, I was scared to get the covid vaccine because of the rumors but I get it now
1/0	Ok Kate, I've had both my vaccines if I'm not dead in 2 years you owe me Doctor Who Blu-ray's and a KFC.
0	Ok but zeneca was defiantly bad. (Lots of evidence) And if they let that out then the other could be just as bad
0/1	Ok so is death a common side effect of taking the vaccine?
0/0	Ok they keep you from dieing from covid. But what's the side effects what's the long term damage. Say what you want ill take my chances with COVID
0/0	Ok they keep you from dieing from covid. But what's the side effects what's the long term damage. Say what you want ill take my chances with COVID.
0/-1	Ok, I am totally for vaccines! But, with how fast this was pushed out? People shouldn't get it...
0/-1	Ok...to be fair, show us the side effects of covid by the same numbers. Gee, I wonder which I would take a chance on.
1/1	Okay I take vaccines.
1/1	Okay but in the end, we should trust the people who have dedicated their lives to understanding this more than people who have done research.
1/1	Okay say you don't take the vaccine contract the virus and spread it to someone older. At which point the odds of dying for elderly and immunocompromised folks is much higher. Not to mention if you have to be hospitalized you're uselessly using up hospital beds and medical workers time. I'm very aware that you're incredibly dense and likely won't take any points in contradiction to yours seriously but not taking the vaccine is an incredible act of selfishness and stupidity.
1/1	Okay, but not getting vaccinated isn't only affecting you. It puts people who are physically incapable of getting vaccines at risk as well. Those people need herd immunity. If you have no signs that you would be at risk for side effects and no prior condition that would make vaccination impossible, then choosing not to get vaccinated is a choice that needlessly endangers others.
0/0	Old vaccines that actual do tuff and don't need to be mandated, I am less leery of. New mRNA vaccines 1) have issues 2) seem to do more than advertised 3) are being pushed so hard they will go into our food. Why are they trying too hard to get them into us?
0/0	Omg she just rams that fucking needle in there!
1/1	Omg team Novavax! I had some tiredness after Novavax. That’s pretty much it. No fever or chills or feeling crappy for 3 days like I did from Moderna. I’m not going back to Moderna again.
0/0	Omicron is safer than the jab.
1/1	Oml yasss the best news I’ve ever heard in MONTHS! I really hope it passes phase 3 so we can all go back to normal! To everyone who is reading this! Congrats on surviving 2020! <3
1/-1/1	On 11/22 it's time for me, thank you.
0/0	On Christmas Day, my GF and I spent 7 hours visiting, eating, and chatting with about 17 people who are all fully vaccinated. At least 8 of them are either currently sick with covid or just getting over it.
0/0	On autism; what do you say to the thousands of parents, our closest friends included, who saw their child lose their mind to autism the day after the MMR?
1/1	On my 1. dose only my arm hurt a bit, hardly noticable. I however had negative side effects from the 2. dose. I had quite annoying flue symptoms for 2 days straight (headache, fever, sleeping for 15 hours a day, hurting muscles). Now my 2. dose is more than 2 weeks past, I am fully vaccinated and there is only 5% chance left for me to show covid-symptoms. I am less likely to spread it and if I do get it the symptoms will likely be weaker. I gladly swap 2 days of sick leave to protect myself and others from a rampant, life-threating desease. It's a no-brainer. I don't have to worry anymore about easily contracting, spreading or dying because of covid
1/1	On the plus side, I only got COVID one time, so the vaccine did a pretty good job of keeping it at bay.
0/0	One can only hope that all who lost their job in Australia for refusing the jab will be fully reinstated.
0/1	One coding theme was 'COVID-19 vaccines have a microchip.
1/1	One dose down, one to go. Thanks to @Publix for making this so convenient! #CovidVaccine #Moderna https://t.co/aUyvsjlo1Q
1/1	One for the teama matter of course, fully vaccinated as I work in healthcare
1/0	One in million getting side effects is not an issue, but one in a million effected or die due to COVID was a big issue to stop every activities.... Double standards
0/0	One of my best friends developed confusion and memory loss after the Pfizer (at least 2). Hospital told the family she had a brain infection and she was gone within a month. Prior to that, her memory was very sharp.
1/1	One of my family members had a talk with me about how they "think their immune system can handle it" and are "only getting vaccinated to protect people around them".
1/-1	One of the benefits of age, getting two per year. Only problem is that six months later the vaccine is much less effective due to the virus mutating.
0	One of the best life decisions I made for me and my family was NOT to take any shots of any covid vaccines regardless the great panic and great social pressure against the unvaccinated
0/0	One of the guys at my work took the vaccine by Pfizer and it took him out of work for a week.
1/1	One of the proudest moments I’ve had in a while was when one of my cube neighbors, a Black chemical engineer, unexpectedly stopped by my desk (standing 6 ft away, both of us wearing masks) and thanked me for prattling on about being vaccinated and the (good) experience I had with the whole thing. He heard me over the wall, and my experience helped convince him to get over some entirely warranted hesitation, given the history there. He got his first dose last week, no side effects, and I’ll be cheering him on when he goes for his second.
1/1	One of the side effects is not dying
1/1	One of the things we have to recognise in this pandemic was we were very fortunate that we got a vaccine quickly that worked
0/-1	One should not get one immediately if one is low risk working in a non critical job, and there are others who are higher risk of criticality than you.
0/-1	One should not if one has a pre-existing medical condition that makes it inadvisable, as informed by your medical professional.
0/1	One simply has to look at history not to long ago. The way humanity got rid of poliomyelitis is the only method.
1/1	One step closer to hugging my loved ones again!
1/1	One thing I noticed reading the comments of anti-vaxxers is that they are incredibly incapable of putting together a coherent and grammatically correct sentence. Almost every one of them. Just an observation.
0/-1	One thing I'd like to know to before I can change my mind. Is it actually going to solve the pandemic? After this hope campaign for 'the cure', increasingly hearing people and politicians not sugar coating it anymore and sow some doubt that after the vaccinations this might not even be over. I'm not really sold on this consumption based solution.
1/1	One thing I've never understood is how anti-vaxxers can tell the difference between issues (e.g. inflammation) supposedly caused by the vaccine and issues caused by the virus
0/0	One thing that I am very happy about is that people are finally I repeat, finally lifting an eyebrow !!! You know, they say better late than never I understand, but millions of people are suffering because of this Covid so-called vaccine, very unfortunate !!
1/1	One thing that is really promising is that this particular vaccine candidate was based around the concept of using RNA to express the antigen. If this vaccine proves to be secure, effective and efficient it may mean that we could create vaccines against other infectious diseases such as Dengue much easily and cheaply. For me that was the particular appeal of this candidate.
1/1	One thing that's good about these troglodytes not getting vaccinated, is that the words collective IQ is about to raise several points in the near future.
1/1	One ís born with autism, you don't get it from covid vaccine. Can antivaxxers please educate themselves.
1/1	Only a handful of people have had adverse reactions to the vaccine as compared to over 300,000 deaths in the US from COVID-19 alone. I understand this can be scary but sometimes the benefits outweigh the risks
0/0	Only anaphylaxis was allowed to be reported. The data was redacted in studies.
0/1/0	Only been sick once from Covid in the 5 years it’s been around yet everybody I know who got the vaccine has had it multiple times. Weird huh. Never took it seriously and I’m doing fine
0/0/-1	Only ever had side effects from the original AZ vaccine. Sore arm from the rest but that's it.
0/0	Only if it becomes mandatory because then my choice is taken away. I'm not an anti vaxxer (my husband child and I have had all our vaccines) but I feel this vaccine has been rushed out and I don't trust it.
0/-1	Only listen to the experts that we want u to listen to...Just don't listen to all the other experts that have come forward...
1/1	Only once AFAIK, was a moderate sickness. No side effects from the vax, I’ve had all the boosters. Glad I got them
1/0	Only one BILLION doses of Ivermectin? Sorry, but not sufficient numbers to even instigate the interest in or the expense of clinical trials for human use of a horse and cow medicine. And we already have a certified safe and effective medicine for the treatment of Covid. A Certified sticker can be obtained with a pair of scissors and a bag of crisps. The safe and effective label can be transferred from a package of suppositories. And our Prime Minister endorsed medicine was subjected to rigorous testing. At least the glass bottle containers were tested, and found safe and effective as containers. Dr. John, how do these people respect themselves? It is frightening that so many MP's cheered, being motivated only by their antipeople party doctrine.
1/1	Only one method doesn't risk me dying gasping for breath as I drown in my own body fluids.
1/1	Oof, I’m getting my first dose tomorrow and I’m kind of nervous, but this made me feel a little better
1/-1	Ooh I already know how this comment section is gonna look I hope they do it, there is far too much stress on the medical system
0/0	Ooooo them juicy boosters that's never been tested on a human. Only mice. Looking forward to rejecting that too as with all the rest
1/1	Opposition to vaccination has posed a challenge to herd immunity, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to populations with inadequate vaccination rates.
1/1	Opposition to vaccines is socially irresponsible. Vaccines have been proven to save countless lives. Everyone should get the covid vaccine ASAP!
0/0	Or we can start to use (available and cheap) treatments instead of vaccination
0/0	Or you can just.... loose weight and eat healthy and more than anything be cautious about how you breathe close too and around strangers. You will not get the virus if you are always aware to keep being cautious.
0/0	Or, maybe we just saw that the ""vaccine"" wasn't inoculating, even after boosters - So an ineffective messenger RNA injection has nothing to do with interest in protecting others or ourselves.
1/-1	Ordinarily I’d ignore this degree of stupidity...but the most dangerous thing this would lead to is a reversal of all the gains towards vaccines acceptance. When you have a large population following you, you must be responsible with your words! This message is a health problem!
0/0	Organic for life keep your chemicals to yourselves 🌱🌱
0/-1	Others might have had past experiences involving negative health reactions to vaccines, making them hesitant toward other types of vaccines and potentially more susceptible to vaccine mis/disinformation.
1/1	Our (now former) German minister of health nailed it when he said a few days ago: "Next year EVERYONE is either vaccinated, recovered or deceased." In German all three words start with the letter "g" and we have a rule which is called 3G, meaning one have to be either vaccinated, recovered or tested (also starts with a "g") in order to be allowed into shops or venues. Quite a macabre word play, but he is right, there is no hiding from the virus. Fun fact: The new German minister of health is Professor for Epidemiology, Health politics and Health management at Harvard.
0/0	Our Body, Our Choice. Nothing mandatory should be forced into our body, ever.
1/1	Our Newcomers' Centre Team got vaxxed the 4th or even 5th time!
0/0	Our best shot is to take care of our bodies with healthy eating, vitamins, avoid drinking, and exercise
0/0	Our body makes protein on its own. The jab is not necessary.
0/0	Our body our choice if we have to get the shot then all women that want Abortions can’t get one! If life is that important then that needs to happen as well! They say there trying to save lives when in fact! There trying to make money off Americans, if they didn’t make any money they would not be doing the mandate and if they didn’t make any money they would be against killing babies! That’s alright people hold strong for another year we will have the house and senate and the mandates if in effect will be canceled! The vaccine has DNA Altering Nanobots they have a resident frequency ,that’s why they want everybody vaccinated so they can monitor and control everybody with frequencies, look it up research it, don’t take my word but I have natural Immunity my body can fight off a virus without another virus being shot into my body that could really hurt me, you get one shot then two then boosters! It will never end until you all are controlled by them, sad very sad!
1/1	Our company organized a vaccination campaign, and employees actively participated in signing up.
1/1	Our daughter got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at 6 months old. She got her final dose in the series earlier this month and did really well with each injection with no ill-effects so far. Our pediatrician explained that it was a good idea to move forward with vaccination - that within the pediatric community there have been rare cases of adenovirus causing complications in babies who had previously been infected with Covid-19, leading to liver issues and need for transplant. This is a virus the body normally fights off but like she said, in rare cases among the very young - previous covid-19 infection created a vulnerability to adenovirus in this population not previously observed.
0/0	Our government doesn&#39;t care about our health because everyone has excepted greed as long as they get to satisfy their own lists for money and control.
1/1	Our health care organizations and societies advocate that all health care and long-term care employers require their workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. This is the logical fulfillment of the ethical commitment of all health care workers to put patients as well as residents of long-term care facilities first and take all steps necessary to ensure their health and well-being," they wrote in the joint statement issued Monday. Well said. It's imperative they get vaccinated.
1/1	Our hospital was giving it out with our flu shot,so we all got it this year 🤷🏽♀️ I’m open to any vaccine offered to me tbh.
0/0	Our immune system have defended us from these viruses just fine for the past thousand years
0/1	Our local health department has all three usually, we just have specify which you want when you make your appointment. Our CVS is next to useless, Albertsons Osco only has Moderna/Pfizer, Costco is variable which ones they have (and they also gate keep more). In Novavax's case unique case here, the health department won't make an in-stone appointment until they have 6 people set up to take it, because once it's thawed, that's it, they either use it all up or they have to throw it out. Then as soon as they get 6 people signed up wanting it, they'll call you and give you a certain day to come in. So it's a bit more finagley to get it than Moderna/Pfizer....but unlike the mRNA vaccines, I had zero side effects with Novavax.
0/-1	Our pediatrician doesn't recommend the COVID vaccine for infants. His reasoning is that COVID tends to be so mild in healthy babies and children and therefore the benefits don't outweigh the risks.
1/-1	Our position is that vacccines should be universally available for free, but that we should have the most recent and effective ones. We also know that vaccines do not prevent infection or #LongCovid and that we need to employ #CleanAir measures in this ongoing pandemic.

1/1	Our yoga instructor died from Covid before vaccines were available. Breathwork is a major part of our practice and is considered to have all sorts of health benefits. He'd held a small gathering at his home, and I'd opted out, as it didn't seem wise. Nearly everyone came down with the virus, a couple had to be hospitalized. He meant well--RIP. While I subscribe to natural health practices, I strike a balance when it comes to pandemics. Got vaxxed as soon as I was eligible.

They let the media/government brainwash them into being a guinea pig for this unproven poison and there’s no legal recourse for when you have side effects or die because the government put protections on the these companies producing this junk.

1/1	People: have u developed the vaccine? Scientists: yes Karens and antivax: good that's one loose end
1/1	Perhaps the only way we can resolve this stupidity of the anti-vax situation is having insurance companies step in… In my view, getting vaccinated is as much a social responsibility as paying taxes.
1/-1	Perhaps we need to devote more scientific research to finding a cure for stupidity.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers.
1/1	Perhaps, but I was getting so downtrodden on these covid subreddits about how the then-current vaccine was so old and that variant is essentially not worth expending for an any day now vaccine coming out. So I really felt like whatever protection I was getting would be lukewarm at best. This wave is so aggressive, I just wanted to protect my family and I feel guilt at not having done that.
1/1	Personal choice is fine, but public health matters too.
1/1	Personal experiences apart, there is also a social responsibility that anti-vaxxers cannot ignore, when people can make others sick it's no longer a question of individual choice or individual freedom.
0/0/0/0/0	Personally I'm a bit skeptical of these new methods since there was a period in Sweden where there was a major outbreak which caused rapid developement of a vaccine which ended up having huge side effects discovered a couple years later, I think I'll wait and see if any side effects show up before getting it myself
0/0	Personally how could anyone insist on people getting vaccinated with a vaccine that had only been tested over a couple of months & believe it would be ok & safe??? That was my argument & refused to be vaccinated & yes I'm still here. I did have covid before it became public. Yes I felt pants but no worse than a bad cold. I think those who lost jobs due to refusing the vaccine & rightly so. Should be reinstated & awarded wrongful loss of earnings.
0/0	Personally, I won’t be.
0/1	Personally, I’ll avoid taking vaccine when it comes out and wait a bit(probably no more than half a year after initial release of vaccine) to be sure it’s safe or reasonably safe after which I’ll take it.

1/1	Please get them vaccinated. I work in a children’s hospital and we are seeing so many new cases of severe COVID-19 morbidity among younger age groups, particularly among the unvaccinated. I cannot recommend getting vaccinated enough, especially with the Delta and Lambda variants going around. Definitely speak to a healthcare professional about your concerns, though, don’t just listen to people on Reddit.
1/1	Please get vaccinated! There are exemptions for those that cannot get vaccines, and in the meantime if you really don't want a vaccine for other reasons, you're still free to get a job where it's not required. People do not have the right to spread communicable diseases to others.

1/1	Please note that the following is not directed at WION, but instead at people who disregard facts and instead choose fantasy over scientific research.<br><br>How is EVERYONE ignoring the fact that out of almost 100 MILLION people, only SEVEN showed symptoms of brain inflammation???? And even if these side affects were more abundant, they are still very minor side affects which haven&#39;t actually killed a single person. The advantages of vaccines outweigh the tiny sliver of side affects a thousand times to one. No vaccines do NOT cause autism, heart failure, or any other kind of sever &quot;side affect&quot; you can think of, and actual scientific studies show this. If you took even just 30 minutes out of your day to do your own research on this subject, you would see that (unless you are allergic to something in the vaccine) it is literally physically impossible for a vaccine to cause any &quot;sever side affects&quot; that people have all but made up to actually do any significant damage to your body. Take the Moderna Covid Vaccine for example, the vaccine does not &quot;change your DNA&quot; or anything of the sort, it is simply RNA (which is physically impossible to use to edit or create DNA), which tells your body how to produce spike proteins of the Covid virus, which can do nothing but activate an immune response from the body and thus learn how to fight Covid shall it ever actually encounter it. The &quot;rna&quot; in &quot;Moderna&quot; literally stands for RNA, they have been studying the application of RNA in vaccines for almost/over a decade. Please do not listen to people on the internet who tell who stories about how &quot;the vaccine gave my kid a heart disease and made him autistic&quot;, because they are certainly lying.<br><br>TLDR: Don&#39;t be an idiot and listen to people online, do your own research.<br><br>P.S: I know I&#39;m late but I just wanted like to share my information about vaccines and hopefully help educate the uneducated on this subject matter :)

0/0	Proud antivaxxer here. I didn't take it, and don't have any health problems whatsoever. I'm glad I was able to read all the information and make an informed decision to not have mysterious substances injected into my body. Feels good to be a critical thinker!
0/0/0/0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO. I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.

0/0	Prowed anti waxxer
0/0	Public health is now an oxymoron and trust has not just been compromised it has been destroyed.
1/1	Public health matters more than corporate profits.
0/0	Public health officials, cowed by the anti-vax crowd, stuck to the line that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.
1/1	Public health policies are based on science.
1/1	Public officials should create awareness by showing footage of nations deeply affected by Covid. USA is sitting on a pedestal of privilege. Here in India, everything collapsed and I have seen so many people die that it almost felt like the apocalypse. I am still healing from the trauma.
0/0	Public trust was broken in 2021, I don't think it can be repaired (unless there was a Truth and Reconciliation Commission done on mandates)
1/-1	Published clinical evidence from COVID-19 trials has indicated that the vaccines are well-tolerated with mild or moderate severity adverse effects.
0/0/0/0/0/0	Pure blood here and proud of it !!

0/-1	RIP Brandy Vaughan. Brandy Vaughan was founder of learntherisk.org. As a former big pharma rep, she became a vocal critic of big Pharma, educating people about dangers of vaccines and pharma drugs.
1/1	RN here, My son got his as soon as it was available for the babies, he was about 10 months.My husband and I then got COVID when he was 13 months old, and literally all he got were some green boogers! He has gotten boosters as they’ve become available and we have had very good experiences. We’re coming out of it now. But the US has been experiencing a tripledemic every winter of flu, COVID, and RSV, so every bit of prevention you can do to keep the little babes out of the hospital is so helpful!
0/0	RNA its human body operating system it took Bill Gates 30 years to make windows working (anybody remember windows vista?) after zylion crushes and now they want mess with my RNA? I dont think so.

0/0	Rare neurological side effects, rare blood clots, add them all together they become not so rare..
0/0	Rare?? 500% increase in heart attacks and 300% for strokes… rare… plausible deniability to avoid Nuremberg trials.
1/1	Rather have a sore arm than end up in the hospital
0/0	Read the book Turtles All The Way Down: Vaccine Science and Myth for an eye opening look at the poor data behind vaccines.
0/0/0	Read the report out of Alberta Canada on Pfizer's own studies of their vaccine. 270ish pregnant women joined the study. 238 of them did not give birth. Almost 20 babies died after birth.
1/1	Ready for the downvotes, but I am also pro-vax and my daughter is fully vaxxed per CDC schedule. We have chosen not to do the covid shot for her. Our family has had covid twice since she was born (19 months old). Though she wasn’t tested, we can only assume she also had it both times since both her parents who were caring for her had it. First time she had no symptoms whatsoever. Second time she had sniffles for a few days. Our pediatrician says it’s largely unnecessary for her age group, but recommends it when she’s a bit older.
1/1	Real-world data from the UK look amazing
1/1	Really appreciate it how he did this episode I someone who got the vaccine and had covid I really appreciate it
0/0	Really regret it. Still got COVID four times after getting three jabs. Plus my health has sharply declined past two years.
0/0	Really regret taking the vaccine, ever since I took it I've had to go to multiple doctors and 2 specialists and they are all trying to identify why I have hypertension and why it's uncontrollable.
0/0	Really? I still have long covid, vaccine 2021. In the future I will think twice before I take a vaccine.
1/1	Received every Pfizer vaccine + booster since it became available. Haven’t had Covid once, and that’s with multiple close contact exposures
1/1/1	Received my Moderna booster last week. Absolutely no after effects.
0/0	Record time = skip proper human clinical trials(which takes at least 2-3 years)
1/0	Refusing a vaccine in a pandemic is like refusing a parachute when jumping out of a plane.
1/1	Refusing the vaccine is just asking for trouble.
1/1	Refusing the vaccine isn’t a personal choice when it affects everyone else.
1/1	Refusing the vaccine isn’t just about you—it’s about the vulnerable people around you. Be responsible. 🏥
1/1	Refusing vaccines should be illegal, and those caught somehow raising unvaccinated children should have their children taken away from them and vaccinated. Big pharma is insanely greedy in the states, I know, but we can't allow anti vaxxers to fuck up their kids' lives just because they believed some shit they read online. Conspiracy theorists and the like can ruin their own lives, in their own little bubble, completely isolated from the rest of the sane world. But when you endanger others' lives, especially your own CHILDREN, then you should be fucking detained. How anti-vaxxers are still allowed to do this to their children is beyond me.
1/1	Regardless of age, whether young or old, everyone should get vaccinated because the virus doesn’t discriminate.
1/1	Regardless of the number of troops…, they should reconsider their choice, discharge is not honorable— please get vaccinated and continue to serve our nation with honor.
1/1	Regardless, get your vaccines! Mask up when community spread starts rising!
0/0	Regret taking an experimental product with only 6 months bogus safety testing? You bet. And what are the long term effects?
0/-1	Regret.
0/0	Regret. I felt horrible after my second moderna shot.
0/0	Regret. Was unnecessary
0/0	Regretfully the videos that are nicely read and with the most beautiful indoctrinating voices are the ones that make me become more skeptical, sorry to say but I don't believe in the few monopolized information sources no matter how beautiful they sound. There are so many different opinions and no open space for discussion allowed. We need freedom and not brainwash.
1/-1	Religious exemptions to sensible public health measures is dumb af
1/1	Relying only on masks and quarantine is not enough—vaccination is the best long-term protection strategy.
0	Remember Bill Gates on Ted Talk said this: "We will have 9 Billion people in the world soon but with VACCINES, HEALTHCARE and REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES we can cut that number by 10-15%, That means that Mr. Gates wants to kill a minimum of 900 million people with VACCINES, HEALTHCARE and REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES. That's enough information for me to say I'm not taking this untested jab. What are going to be the repercussions in 5 -10 years down the road. You have no recourse if you are disabled by the vaccine and there is no accountability by the manufacturers. You can't sue the manufacturer thanks to your legislatures. They even made a special court just for vaccine related injuries back in the 70's because of so many law suits were brought against the manufacturers it was about to put them out of business.
1/-1	Remember Guys, these are VERY SAFE and VERY EFFECTIVE and VERY USEFUL for things that DO exist and for diseases CAUSED by bad GERMS
0/0	Remember back in 2019 when nobody had ever heard of sudden adult death syndrome before?

1/1	Remember get vaccinated kids!
0/0	Remember if it’s free, you are the product, and in this case you are the experiment. Stand strong against your employers and this type of “leadership”.
1/1/1/0	Remember it's not just the deaths, it's the potentially worse outcomes of the disease. It's the permanent damage that covid could cause to bodies which is also significantly lowered by the vaccine.
1/1	Remember polio? Yeah, me neither. Vaccines work.
1/1	Remember that 200 years ago people ate organic food and didn't vaccinate and lived to the great age of died in childhood.
1/1	Remember the last time you contracted polio or measles? No. Because you were vaccinated. All school children have to provide vaccination records, so how is this different?
0/0	Remember this Gates wouldn’t allow his children to get the vaccineI’m sure he never took the deadly injections
0/1	Remember when anti-vaxxers were just this little group of crazies that everyone else laughed at?
0/0	Remember when one dose was considered to be fully vaccinated? Remember when people laughed at "conspiracy theorists" who knew that there would be unending doses?
0/0	Remember when they said cigarettes were safe? Same playbook
0/0	Remember when they were offering Ca$h to get the Jab ? What a joke
1/1	Remember, vaccines have played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of infectious diseases throughout history. They remain one of the most effective public health interventions available, and their benefits in reducing the burden of COVID-19 cannot be overstated.
0/0	Remind me who was pushing the Warp Speed "vaccine" on America again.
0/0/0	Reminder that none of the people who didn't take it regret their decision
1/1	Reminder that the reason we give vaccines is that the risks associated with their diseases is FAR higher than the risks associated with the vaccine. Your baby is far more likely to suffer Covid complications than complications with the actual shot.
0/0	Remove all vaccine legal liability shields! Since the vaccines are so "safe and effective" it should be no problem...
0/0/1	Repeat COVID-19 vaccinations elicit antibodies that neutralize variants, other viruses. Unlike immunity to influenza, prior immunity to SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t inhibit later vaccine responses.
0/-1/0	Rescind all vaccine legal liability shields.
0/0	Research bla bla bla... But the truth lies in the time.... Long term.... Only time will tell if there is any long term effects... That is something studies don't know... Yet. So that is still a potential risk nobody really wants to mention.
1/-1	Research has shown the relationship between education level and vaccine hesitancy in the US was like a U-shape since those with less than high school education and those with PhDs were the most hesitant to get COVID-19 vaccines.
1/1	Research shows vaccines are safe and effective.
1/1	Researchers Prove Anti-Vaccine Idiots' Baseless Conjecture Was Baseless Conjecture. No One Is Surprised.

0	Right, like 97% of Doctors agreed with covid lockdowns or vaccines. Wrong! They just silence anyone who disagrees!
0/0	Risk of dying from COVID is higher? Really? I don’t know that de-novo thrombocytopenia was that common or that benign from an m&m standpoint. (It’s not, btw).
0/0	Risk reward should be judged by the patient after they are given the information of both the risks and rewards. It’s not predetermined by the physician
0/1	Risking jail rather than get a free vaccine? That’s why they call them Q-Anon and not IQ-Anon.
1/-1	Robustly tested
0/0	Roses are red, free thinkers are few, keep doing what they say, you'll get a chip in you.

1/1	Sad that it can happen but saving many lives with a vaccine is the chance worth your life…. Just like driving a car on a freeway or many other things we do all the time.
0/0	Sad that so much false information has been spread claiming these "vaccines" are safe and effective. Vaxed lll has many testimonies from people that had family members, or themselves, injured or family members that died.
1/-1	Sad to see this 8 months later and people are still stupid af…
0/0	Sadly I took 2 doses..I regret , I don't feel anything but who knows. I will keep praying to Lord keep me safe and intact from any negative impact
1/0	Sadly, however, they don’t just endanger themselves and die out but also endanger their young kids who don’t know better or others and deplete herd immunity. Fucking selfish ideology.
0/0	Sadly, the Covid vaccine is likely to have killed more people than the plane crashes as yet more people succumb to turbo cancer, blood clots, heart failure and myelin blocked blood vessels.
0/0	Safe (if you don't take it) and Effective (at creating just as many problems as it fixed)
0	Safe and Effective? Never forget the lies! It was very hard being one of the great unwashed unvaxxed but well worth the stand.
1/1	Safe and effective
0/0	Safe and effective for those who did not take it!

1/0	Safer than mRNA, a new technology, never tested for too long in human history. Good luck to that
0/0	Salt sugar and mRNA = Powerpuff vaccine
1/1	Same as with Flatearthers or believers in Homeopathy or conspiracy theories like there never was a Moon landing: you can't convince anti-vaxxers. They're lost too deeply in their bs.
1/1	Same for myself, vaccinated and boosted, one mild case of COVID. Slight fever, slightly runny nose, barely sick lasted three days, then I was better.
1/1	Same here. I’m still having lingering waves of brain and exhaustion symptoms from having it earlier this month. I’m def getting the next vaccine as soon as I can.
0/0	Same me! Vaccines might be work but few people could die. Then Who?
0/0	Same thing. Gov job, knew I would not take it under any circumstance. I told my PM I had no interest in taking it, which he clearly shared with other leadership because a higher up that I previously had a good relationship with started treating me very different and randomly telling me stories about how many people at him and his wife knew that were dying from covid and how he was glad to be vaxxed. Submitted for a religious exemption and eventually they just stopped asking. Still in disbelief that it happened and so many people fell prey to the obvious lies. Even more mind boggling are the people who still track and look forward to their next jab, more alarmingly people that are very intelligent. It’ll never make sense to me, but I am glad I didn’t inject that poison into my body. Seems like in general the people that did have had their health gradually decline and are always getting sick.
1/-1	Same! And friends and job and school. Take that everyone
0/0	Same, ever since I got the jab my heart has rapidly been pounding for several points throughout the day.
1/1	Same. I had to pay out of pocket for the COVID vaccine, but I’ve managed to avoid getting it at large events where people all around me got it this fall.
1/1/1/1	Same. I have both scheduled for tomorrow. It's the least I can do to help protect immune compromised folks and those who can't take vaccines.
1/0	Same. I was called a bad mom by some for refusing the vax for myself and 3 children. We had covid 1 time with mild symptoms so now have natural immunity even tho ppl refused to admit that. ❤ 🙏 for those having health issues.
1/1	Same. I’ve had 5 covid vaccines all up, and haven’t caught it yet.
1/1	Sandra Westley uk, this is old hat, vaccine saves lives, I have had 2 Astra Zeneca, and now I’ve just had my booster of Pfizer, the only side effect was a sore arm, as I am in my 70 tys having the vaccine against getting COVID-19 in a no brainier.

1/1	Saying that vaccines cause autism is as stupid as saying water causes autism.
1/1	Saying you can breathe away covid is like saying you can walk off polio 🤣 If my gov didn't push the vax on me, I don't think I'd be alive today. Even with 2 shots, being only 25yrs old and v fit, I was practically on my death bed. U don't know how crippling it can actually be.

1/1	Second dose done! No side effects for me. Ready to hug my grandparents again.
0/0	See how they keep saying it's "rare" but it isn't. Had so much of my family get sick and strokes and die of heart attacks. They keep saying "rare" as if the vaccine doesn't cause it.
0/0	See the great lengths they go to to force you to take it. Ask why they want that so badly. Surely it must out of genuine concern for your health, right?
1/1	Seeing all the misinformation out there is frustrating. The vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and are proven to be safe. Let's trust science and protect each other.
0/0	Seeing as the earlier predictions held that a vaccine would be available in late 2021, this feels extremely rushed. I'm fully expecting this new vaccine to fail to work.

1/1	Send him a CDC link. Tell him you won't be with someone unvaccinated for no medical reason. If unvaccinated is a dealbreaker for you and he won't get it, break up.
1/1	Send the vaccine to the third world countries where it needed. Because we want to continue our lives without compromising those most vulnerable groups of our population.

0/-1	Serious question Does anyone know someone personally who died from covid asking for a friend

0/0	Shocking. I know a handful of people who had serious heart problems and cancer after vaccines. Young fit healthy people. Blood clots too.
0/0	Shooting into your blood steam is a bad idea. I do not care if I die by disease, come for me death, I will join the billions before me. I will take my 0.1 chances.
1/1	Should be called Pro-jab.
0/0	Should file case against the company and the government for forcing us to get vaccinated
1/1	Should have asked her if she knows anyone who has contracted polio or tuberculosis.
1	Should have gotten the Vaccine
1/1	Shout out to all the bio nerds that have been quietly solving the problems and finding the solutions without raising cries for praise. They are the true heroes
1/1	Shoutout to all the frontline workers making this happen!
1/1	Shoutout to my boys at Pfizer. Shoutout to vaccines. Shoutout to vaccination. Shout out to herd immunity. Vaccination gang gang.
0/-1	Shove your vaccine where the sun doesn't shine.
1/1	Show ads on TV and show families of unvaccinated people who have died.
1/1	Shows that gullible uneducated people are easily misled by charlatans, convinced of their own right(s), and sometimes pay for not trusting experts with their lives.Being an expert is good! Many people here are probably mechanics, plumbers, technicians, carpenters, and I have everlasting respect for the complicated and arcane knowledge you have. You make the world what we want it to be. But so do doctors and epidemiologists, they don't know more about plumbing than I do, but they know a lot more about viruses and epidemics than either of us. And there's nothing wrong with that. We can't all be experts on everything.
1/1	Shut up. What ELSE do I got? “YOUR COVID AND FLU SHOTS!” Correct! Now, get yours, gosh darn it!
0/0	Sicko-Stop the brainwashing techniques- How much do they pay you to sell your soul- to promote these killing weapons? Jesus help him!!
0/0/1	Side effects are as follows : you Will be a walking zombie conneced to 5g network.. big brother going to control you like. Freakin algorithms
1/1	Side effects are mild compared to the dangers of COVID-19.
0/-1	Side effects are more like a traditional flu vaccine than an mRNA covid vaccine.
1/1	Side effects are rare and mild compared to COVID itself.
1/1	Side effects exist, but so do COVID deaths.
1/1	Side effects may also include : prolonged period of lifetime on earth
1/1	Side effects were minor, way better than getting COVID!
1/-1	Side effects: reaching adulthood, not dying , chance of not getting sick
1/1	Side effects? Yeah, I felt a little tired. But I'd rather be tired for a day than on a ventilator. Easy choice. 😴
0/0	Side-effects concern not about immediate effects but moderate and long-term effects; you can't know from other vaccines because by your own admission COVID19 vaccine has been developed not only in a short period but using a different process
0/1	Sigh, looks like too few people have a college degree. All university students got vaccinated, yet I don't see a single one of them with side effects. Why is that?
0/0	Simple. They don't
1/1	Simple: the body can’t fight covid by itself effectively that’s why we need a vaccine
1	Simplest explanation of antivaxxers: They love their sense of high drama far more than they love their kids.
1/1	Since I got the vaccine I don't wheeze when I go upstairs, my legs are sharper, and the older women say I'm about ten years younger.
0/0	Since I've had all the COVID vaccines it's destroyed my immune system I've had coughs and colds shingles no more for me I was fit and healthy before all those vaccinations
1/1	Since democracy is a majority-rules form of government, it's about time leaders have found tools to begin enforcing the wishes of the majority of Americans. It took them long enough, to the tune of 656,000 souls. And, I seriously doubt that any religion really purports that its god wouldn't him or herself get vaccinated for the good of common men.
0/0	Since everyone else got vaccinated, I figured it's fine if I don't—I'm just not getting it, hehe.
0/0	Since my 1st and 2nd dose in 2021... have had 24/7 dizziness, brain fog and lightheadedness that wont go away
0/-1	Since my second jab six weeks ago ever bone in my body is in constant pain I wish I never took the vaccine I am mid fifties non smoker and was very fit and healthy but now I have no energy in constant pain and feel my life is ruined
0/0	Since the covid vaccine was introduced I've spent the last four years reading books, articles, watching videos, and listening to interviews on vaccines. What I learned was so disturbing I will never take another vaccine the rest of my life.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/1/0	Since the start of pandemic. I never had any fever and flu even pre pandemic. Not until i had vaccinated with first dose of pfizer last week. The side effects took after 6 days from my vacvination. And its the worst ever. Im even thinking not getting my 2nd dose.
1/1	Since this pandemic I've personally lost around 16 people between me and my partner. None were vaccinated and I still don't understand why people aren't choosing to live vs ending up in the hospital or dead.
1/1/1/1	Since vaccination has put vaccine preventable diseases at the verge of elimination, the fear of such diseases has also decreased. So, people are undermining the importance of Vaccination.
0/0	Since when does the government care about us.
1/1	Sincere question, haven't you heard that vaccination will never protect you completely, but WILL make you less likely to get infected, and when you are infected your symptoms are likely to be milder? Why isn't it enough to know that you might have caught covid twice since winter if you hadn't been vaccinated? Or that your terrible symptoms might have been even MORE miserable without the shot?
0/0	Six of my family members died after taking the vaccine. Two of my cousins have stage 4 cancer.
0/0	Slight increase in heart issues my ass...what's happening in Palastine now is a drop in the ocean conpared to what Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca has done to the world!!!! 😡
1/1	Slightly biased towards mRNA based vaccine but nevertheless, a very simplified and excellent video on why vaccine in general is important. Keep up the good work!
0/-1	Slightly over 15% of participants answered true for this false statement: COVID-19 mRNA vaccines can alter human DNA.
0/0	Slovakia moves to ban the dangerous mrna gene therapy covid drugs posing as a vax. They said it's a bioweapon
0/0	Sly News always speaks the truth!
0/0	Small demonstration in redditch, England - For the first time ever, in redditch .. worcester… England … I saw a group of plucky ladies were standing on a roundabout, with placards (billboards..) stating the lack of information about vaccine side effects; if you read this … you are amazing ladies (i was the person who told you so circling in the blue van) an amazing couragous step ladies, and so refreshing to see someone acting in person than (myself included..) only acting via the internet (but all internet info also truly amazing) - BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO amazing ladies
0/0/0/0/0	Smart girl for declining. The gaslighting around the C19 jabs is OFF THE CHARTS!!!
1/0	Smokey McB While your skepticism in the government is not unfounded it is difficult to claim in good faith vaccines are essentially bioweapons. No amount of cover-up can hide the massive death spike if that is the case. It will be understandable if you are hesitant in mRNA vaccine type because it is relatively new but conventional types such as inactivated (dead) or weakened virus vaccine type have a proven track record. Besides if you are not in the priority list those types will be available by the time it will be your turn and you have a say which vaccine type you will use.
0/-1	Sneezing news reportage for pharmaceutical companies who want another opportunity to jab us with vaccines. God we need a break from this!
0/0	So I got these two shots and got Covid again on a 5% chance
1/1	So I had my second Covid infection 3 weeks ago. Is there a recommended wait period between infection and getting a booster vaccination anymore? Do I have a period of natural immunity that allows me to delay getting my booster for a month or so to push out the effectiveness of the booster further out?
1/1	So I have made a quick debunk article on Medium about the claim that dementia can be caused by vaccination or from the Covid-19 vaccine (we know this isn't possible), please lemme know what you think and have a read through.
0/0	So I'm NOT an anti-vaxxer, but when you say 'this video sponsored by Bill and Melinda gates' my 'uh-oh' meter goes off....
0/-1	So I'm not vaccinated & won't get the jab ever but it is FDA approved..
1/1	So a vaccine is basically a simulation of an infection, kind of like how in the military they have obstacle courses with people firing blanks to simulate actual combat.
0/-1	So are the manufacturers taking care of those affected???? Not a chance, right.???
0/0	So are you all going to keep getting them for the rest of your lives?
1/1	So basically get it if your doctor recommends it based on your risk profile.
0/0	So basically you are saying we should choose to risk our lives for the hope of a good and greater outcome. Respect to you but no thank you.
0/0	So blessed I never took the vax
1/1	So cute!!!! I got the cuteness vaccine, so now I’ve become cute too~~
1/1	So does "targeting the JN.1" mean you would not be protected against some of the current variants? I'm confused as to whether "JN.1" is related to the more current variant or not. And I'm not clear if the Novavax vaccine provides as much protection vs. Pfizer and Moderna. If anyone has a better understanding I would appreciate some info on that. Thanks.
1/1	So does this mean Kamala unvaccinated against Covid? brbrCause I know for a fact that Trump is vaccinated and recommended getting the vaccine. Which confuses me in how hes anti vaccine like why in the world would someone whose anti vaccine get vaccinated then tell his supporters to get vaccinated. Now Trump didnt force people to get vaccinated but this is America not North Korea.
1/1	So don’t take it if that’s your belief, although it does put your community at risk. Why do commenters care so much that those of us that believe in vaccinations embrace the opportunity to prevent severe disease. Get a life.
1/1	So easy, so quick, so worth it!
0/0	So far conspiracy theories are coming true
1/1	So far it seems to be working for me? Wife and I got the vaccine mid-Sept. Since then we went to Disney and Vegas and haven't gotten it (when others we know have). So anecdotal but so far so good.
0/0	So far the articles I have read says that you can still get Covid infection and spread it after you are vaccinated.
0/0/0	So glad I didn't get a single dose of that shit and have vast knowledge about nutrition and self healing.
1/1	So glad I go the jab! No regrets at all! Best thing to ever happen!
1/1	So glad I got vaccinated before the idiocracy came into effect.
1/1	So glad I took my shot today!!!
0/0	So glad I'm jab free. I keep seeing serious side effects popping up.
0/0	So glad I'm not one of the dumbasses taking horse medicine
1/1	So glad for the science of vaccines.
0/0	So glad i never accepted that $#--!! I literally went through hell at work because my boss pressured me to got get jabbed!!! He lied to and manipulated people by promising stipends and all kinds of incentives... then after several people decided to get jabbed, he backed out of those promises stating "ooops!! Its against policy to offer financial incentives to get the shot!!!!"
1/1	So glad the vaccine was finally approved
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	So glad we refused it for my family. It was hard at the beginning when everyone acted like we were grandparent killers but with all these side effects coming out I’m grateful. I have 2 boys with epilepsy. God knows what could have happened.
1/1	So happy my kids are finally vaccinated too!
1/1	So happy my son is now fully vaccinated and so is he! Now he gets to stay in school when there is a case and there has been one everyday at his school for the past five days.
1/1	So happy to be vaccinated! It's a step towards normalcy.
1/1	So happy to see people getting vaccines. I will get the vaccine ASAP
1/1	So happy to see you sir ur are insperetion for many of our people take vacisne May God bless you
1/-1	So helpful video! I created a video about mrna vacines in a news format! It’s entertaining and informational :)
0/0	So he’s not getting sued over vaccines??? Really? Just like the Covid vaccine has no negative effect on your immune system right???? Keep pushing bullshit. It’s embarrassing
1/1	So he’s okay taking up a hospital bed? If he doesn’t believe in science, why not recover at home?
1/0	So how many unvaccinated people died from complications from the vaccine?
0/0	So if I don't get the shot then those around me are still at risk even after they get the shot. Then guess what, if that's the case then the shot does not work.
0/0	So if i die from vaccine it,that doesnt matter as long as i am protecting others by taking something that might kill me??
0/0	So if the injection was so effective, why spikes after it? Also, it’s published now that real infections confer as much immunity as injections. Thus why risk our health with a modified Spike which circulates longer and thus do more damage?
0/0	So if the unvaccinated get vaccinated to protect the vaccinated, then who is going to protect the formerly unvaccinated after they get vaccinated and become part of the protected vaccinated? brbrI think we need a new vaccine to protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated after they become vaccinated, thereby making the vaccinated the new unvaccinated class in need of a vaccine passport to show while they were unvaccinated, they are now vaccinated and therefore in need of a vaccine to further protect the vaccinated from the vaccinated.
0/0	So if you are given a placebo you could die??
0/0	So in other words the vaccines were totally useless.
0/0/0/0	So it's not safe and effective? No s~#*, Sherlock!
0/0	So just 10%of the population is not vaccinated and you think they are the reason coronavirus is not going a way in France? If 90% of the population vaccinated didn’t help I guarantee you even if you vaccinate them all it will still not help, it is obvious that these vaccines are useless What is wrong with you people that you don’t understand this?
0/0	So let me get it straight, scientists want us to take a shot even though its not proven that it protects you from COVID?
1/1	So many YouTube doctors and scientists here that seem to know better than actual science. Have fun in the ICU, idiots.
1/1	So many conspiracy theories about vaccines it's ridiculous...I got the vaccine. I feel great and have a little peace of mind.
1/1	So many damn people disliking the video and talking about "the low risk" You NEVER say NEVER and you NEVER say ALWAYS. That's why the risk is LOW. But the chances that the benefits outweigh the risks are really HIGH. Get it? Comprende?
1/1	So many experts here skeptical of an actual scientist, yet feel 100% comfortable getting their scientific data from their uncle's Facebook memes.
0/0	So many long lasting S/E’s! More research is needed!!
1/1/1	So many of the comments here are examples of misinformation and baseless generalizations. I see no credible proof provided from anyone who is so anti-vaccine that vaccines are not safe. I see name calling, accusations and ignorance. If you don’t want the vaccine, at least stop spreading lies about it.
0/0/0/0/0/0	So many people Having heart attacks.. High Blood pressure. Breathing problems. Hair Loss. Skin problems.. We were injected with poison..
0/0	So many people I know regret taking it
1/1	So many people keep saying it was rushed don’t understand how any other vaccine trials take place
0/0	So many young people are getting heart problems after the shot!
1/1	So much discussion about side effects! What do you think you get from exp. Alvedon, sugar, alcohol?
1/1	So much negativity, I got vaccinated, what’s wrong with it??
0/0	So now that its 2 years out, and we know the vaccines really didnt do what the government said it was going to do. Any comments?
0/-1	So now we&#39;re all controlled by microchips and graphene. However, here we are using social media (mind control) and tracked continuously (by our phones gps).
1/1	So proudl i get
0/0	So rare yet EVERYONE knows someone that's had problems with the jab. The fact that they aren't being documented and the truth is being hidden just further supports my decision
1/1	So relieved that my parents and grandparents are fully vaccinated—it gives me peace of mind
1/1	So relieved to finally be done with my doses!
0/0	So sad for the vaccine victims
1/-1	So sick and tired of the virus
1/-1	So tempted to send this to every anti-vax person I know...
0/0	So thankful I went with my gut instincts and had no vaccine or boosters. So many regret they had them now. God is good. Be well everyone. Be safe. And wash your hands! Often.
1/1	So thankful for free vaccines in my country!
1	So thankful for medical advancements!
0/0	So that's why everybody is acting so damn weird. Thankful I said no to it.
1/1	So the number of people being diagnosed with Covid 19 has gone down the case fatality rate has gone down the number of people with severe illness has gone down so yes they have worked very well.
0/0	So the same companies that have been sued for shady medical practices are now the ones telling us this is safe? Yeah, I don’t know about that
1/0	So the vaccines did NOT impair immune systems ? So the vaccines did NOT cause calcium Ions Disregulation ? … See more
0/0	So these new vaccines can replicate & alter your DNA and we have to trust our government with that. No thanks
0/0	So these nurses risk their entire careers and reputations over one shot? That’s very telling.
0/1	So these people say they know the cause of MS? Please let the MS society know. Also, this would be a dead simple assertion to prove or disprove by showing % MS patients in Covid vaccinated and non-vaccinated populations. Where&#39;s the simple MS % comparison supporting these claims?
0/1	So to protect my children and Grandchildren I got my two vaccines and now am being told the new mutant strain does not respond to the vaccine!! So what was the point?
0/0	So we're just going to insert manufactured genetic sequences into people's bodies? To be fused with their genetic code and all descendants forever... And we think it's a good idea to do this because we can? I'm no science denier or anti-vaxxer,.. but that sounds like a really really dumb thing to do.
1/-1	So weird it didn't happen to ALL vaccinated people. Come on...
0/0	So what happens if the mrna vaccine gives harmful mrna spike proteins to dna?
1/1	So what? Vaccine is here and that’s a good move. Let’s move on and applaud people who get the vaccine. When it’s available to me I’ll be the first one to line up. Yeah
0/-1	So when the polio vax was released it was done in conjunction with the AMA redefining polio. They narrowed the definition of it to the extent that no one could diagnose any patient with polio.
1/0	So who else isn't getting vaccinated
0/0	So why did scientists lie to us, to get people to take the vaccine to help pharmaceutical companies profit? Scientists are not immune to to the effects of being bribed! Look at the head of American CDC, and Fauci, who both outright lied to us, and now have multimillion dollar jobs at pharmaceutical companies they likely don’t even have to show up to work for. In other words, either way, they lied, so the company they now work for could profit into the billions, by recommending a MANDATED vaccine, or loss of your job, for a vaccine they told us would stop you from getting Covid! So, why should they care, and bully, then mandate, others to get the vaccine, if they couldn’t get it from them? It was so the companies could profit, at the cost of the trust of the American public, in anything the CDC tells us in the future!
0/0/0	So why is the creator of mRNA vaccine technology Robert Malone warning us of their dangers?
0/0	So you can still get the virus and infect others sick, why even take it?
0/0	So you decided to put your faith in an unproven vaccine instead of the power of God to heal you, protect you, and keep you from all harm, sure that makes perfect sense to me...NOT!!! I pray you are safe from the harm this vaccine has in it and knowing that it's made from aborted fetuses will definitely keep me away from it.
0/0/0	So you didn't mention the total number of deaths reported by the CDC: "More than 369 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through August 30, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 7,218 reports of death" Is that an acceptable number? Many think this is grossly underreported.
0/0/0	So, "My body, my choice" should totally apply here too, RIGHT?
1/1	So, MTG did get vaccinated!
1/-1	So, now that the definition of vaccine has changed due to the safe and effective covid shots, have anything to add?
0/0	So, to summarize: The Covid 9 vaccine.... - Does not give immunity. - Does not eliminate the virus. - Does not prevent death. - Doesn't guarantee you won't get it. - Doesn't stop you from getting it. - Does not stop you from passing it on. - Doesn't preclude the need for travel bans. - Doesn't preclude the need for business closures. - Doesn't preclude the need for closures. - doesn't preclude the need for concealment. It is so absurd and I wonder why there are people who let this happen to them.
0/-1	So, what you're saying is..... the shot isn't that great....
0/0	So...... when are we going to apologise to the "conspiracy theorists"??
1	Social media "docs", and equating politics with medicine, has caused a lot of dead folks. And it ain't the vaccines that did it.
1/-1	Social media spreads misinformation faster than any virus.
1/1	Some 15 billion doses have been administered. If people still have a problem with, I don't have the energy to argue anymore. There are no hidden secrets.
0/0	Some anti-vaxxers say Bill Gates or other powerful people created the virus as a means to mandate vaccines which would be used to inject people with a microchip so that a global surveillance network can be established.
0/0	Some countries banned certain vaccines due to safety concerns.
0/0	Some countries handled COVID well without strict vaccination policies. Does that mean vaccines weren’t necessary? 🤔
0	Some doctors have concerns about COVID-19 vaccines.
1/1	Some good news: COVID vaccine uptake is up substantially from last year. There is room for improvement, but nearly half of adults 65+ got their 2024-2025 dose so far, up from 35% last year.
0/0	Some healthcare professionals are speaking out against the vaccine, which makes me question its safety.
1/1	Some high risk people can't get the vaccine due to being allergic to the ingredients and things like that. So their "protection" comes from most other people not being able to spread it to them because they're vaccinated. That's what we mean by herd immunity. High risk people who can't get the vaccine are protected by the immunity of the herd
0/1	Some medical professionals are waiting on getting vaccinated citing concerns about the speed at which the vaccine was produced along with any possible risks. Some are also not ready to take something so new and wants to see more focused research on the side effects people are having from the vaccine. Vaccine companies have not have time to test long-term effects.
1/1	Some never got sick and didn't take the vaccines , and they still won't admit it . I call them kowards .
0/0	Some of my friends got vaccinated and still caught COVID-19. It makes me question the effectiveness of the vaccine.
0/0	Some of the healthiest people I know skipped it and are fine.
0/0	Some of the many problems with this point of view are: 1) In general, countries with high vaccination rates had high death rates from covid whereas countries with low vaccination rates had low death rates from covid. 2) It appears that the more C19 vaccinations you get, the more likely you are to get infected & hospitalized. 3) The risks from the vaccines, especially for young healthy people, outweigh the benefits.
0/1/1	Some of them might have a unitary conspiratorial worldview that made them more vulnerable toward particular mis- and disinformation about vaccines.
1/-1	Some people are STILL arguing about vaccines? Move on already.
0/0	Some people are saying that the vaccine can alter your DNA, and that's really scary to me.
0/0	Some people are saying that the vaccine can cause infertility, and that's a big concern for me.
0/0	Some people are saying that the vaccine can cause prion diseases, and that's terrifying.
0/0	Some people around me said they felt all kinds of discomfort after getting vaccinated. I don’t want to take that risk.
0/0	Some people blindly trust so-called experts. By the time they regret it, it’ll be too late.
1/-1	Some people don't believe in education, that's the problem.
1/1	Some people don't believe in science or education, and that's the real problem when it comes to vaccines.
0/0	Some people experience severe side effects after vaccination.
0/0	Some people got vaccinated and still ended up in the hospital. So how much does it really help? 🤷
0/0/0	Some people have a very difficult time admitting they were wrong in getting the shots !
0/-1	Some people like to look before the leap and other like being told what to do.
1	Some people need to be reminded not to think that just because others got vaccinated, they don’t have to. Getting one more shot is no big deal. Being responsible for yourself is also being responsible for others.
0/0	Some people say their health worsened after vaccination.
1/1	Some people trust imaginary friends more than scientists.
1/1	Some people worry about safety, but as long as the vaccine comes from an official source, its quality is guaranteed.
0/0	Some people would never accept this as they were brainwashed into taking it, really sad.
0/-1	Some recipients did report aches and pains !
0/-1	Some recipients did report aches and pains ! I know people who struggle to sleep, have had constant headaches , 2 strokes and one death after being vaccinated. Also several with long COVID who have been vaccinated. So is the vaccine working or did it just take out the 0.5% most vulnerable. Leaving the less vulnerable to make the vaccine look like a success ??
0/-1	Some risk? Huge risks. Slight increase of certain conditions? Huge increase of very serious conditions and disorders. 2000 cases? Try multiplying that a thousand fold. And you haven't covered excess deaths yet.
0/0	Some say the vaccine contains microchips to track personal information—I don’t trust what the authorities say.
0/0	Some say the vaccine doesn't even last that long then they have to give you another one now they had the booster. Do people realize that they have baby fetus in that shot. They don't tell you what you getting just take it. That's not normal to have that kind of stuff put in your body. That would cause problems down the way. These people are not guinea pigs. Did you not see what fauci did with a bunch of dogs this is nuts. Years ago we got shots yes and I gave them to my kids. That built their immune system. This stuff here you have to keep putting shots in people's body this isn't working. Cuz people are still getting sick.
0/0	Some studies show that masks and distancing are enough.
0/0/0	Some things were amazing and some things were handled very poorly, but at least Pfizer has raked in billions, right?
0/0	Some vaccines in the past had issues. I trust this COVID-19 vaccine even less.
0/0	Some who I know that got it are no longer with us. My friend my age 31, has now had 2 strokes and a heart attack. He was fine and had no blood clots or heart problems prior to taking the shot
1/1	Somehow my gut feeling is telling me an Antivaxxer saw this video, saw that Hank said something they didn't like or understand and immediately disliked the video. They seem like the type to just not completely digest the information given to them.
0/0	Somehow people in Belarus 🇧🇾 or Sweden 🇸🇪 didn’t have to take it and are alive
1/1	Someone I know who is on working permit in Malaysia has got her vaccine 1st dose on the 7/June. She is under 50 yr old. There are many of us above 55 years old Malaysian are still waiting to be given our 1st dose and why those under 50 years old is already given? Please explain. 5 2
0/0	Someone who doesn’t want to be injected with an untested drug is not an antivaccine activist. He or she is just a sensible person
0/0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury .
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/1/0/0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0/0	Something is just not right about this. Why promote a vaccine that no one knows anything regarding long effects??
0/0	Something just doesn't add up with these vaccines.
0/0	Something that would take 20 years atleast to develop has taken 1 year.... no thanks Mate. Keep that to yourself
1/1	Sometimes I feel like the best way to end the anti-vax movement is to just let a disease rip through the population. But things usually equal out in the end whether you do anything or not.
1/0	Sometimes when I feel lonely I just think about how all of my cells are fighting hard to keep me healthy every day
1/0	Sometimes, you need to stand back and let the ignorant learn hard lessons. It's like chlorine for the gene pool.
0/0	Soo we’re just not ganna talk about why my arm swelled into a red/itchy golfball size bump on my second shot?!? Cool guess I’ll keep searching…..lol
0/0	Sooo they want us to trust just ONE doctor for this vaccine. Same doctor that folded under pressure and they want is to believe the same government who let’s large fast food restaurant s get away with human and rat meat on their “meat”🤢🤮 it’s a no from me dawg . Theses makers can’t even be held liable for vaccine complications
0/0	Soooo...what's the point of getting the vaccination then! It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
1/1	Soooooooo excited for this vaccine!!! Thank you to all of the scientists who are working so hard to make this happen.
0/0	Sooooooooooo glad my entire family and I did not take the vaxx. Almost 2025 and we're 100% fine.

1/1	Super helpful PSA: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE PRIORITY #1 PEOPLE TO GET THE VACCINE NOW! Call your local CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, supermarkets, etc. I started calling around every day asking for spare vaccines. On day three I found a provider that had extras. I’m under 30 with no health issues. If they have spare vaccines they will give it to anyone who ask that is 18+ I understand this may be exhausting but it worked for me.
1/0	Suppose you want to make people sick. What do you do? Lie about vaccines being bad.
0/0	Supposedly, the adjuvants they add to the vaccine might be the cause of immune issues seen in kids, such as the increase in allergies.
1/1	Sure do. Dragged my husband to the CVS on the corner the day the new vaccine was available and went ahead and did the flu shot. Also making me anxious I can’t get it for my 8 year old yet. My boomer parents have stopped getting vaccinated and now think it’s “making tons of athletes die of heart attacks in their sleep (their words).” I saw InfoWars up on my dad’s chromebook, so they’re a lost cause.
0/0	Sure go ahead and mandate it. Let's get the civil war started.
1/1	Sure it's not 100%, but I'd rather have a shield than be wide open to the virus.
0/0/0/0	Sure nobody who got the vaccine never got covid right?????
0/0	Sure sure, now keep us informed about the person in Placer county in Northern California who died only hours after taking the vaccine.
0/0	Sure you've got heart damage, had numerous clots, had a stroke, a cancer diagnosis and now multiple sclerosis but the vaccine sort of kept you safe from a bit of a cold. Totally worth it.
1/1	Sure, I’m not saying vaccines are worthless but their effectiveness in preventing infections only lasts about 3 months. So not really a practical strategy for the whole population, which is why most countries are only offering free boosters now for old or vulnerable people.
0/0/1	Sure, but the idea is that the vaccine does not really decrease their already low risk a lot further (since there was no big risk to start), so even a low risk needs to be considered carefully. There's no real basis to recommend the vaccine to each and every kid, it needs to be an evaluation based on individual risks and honestly also that person's "risk appetite", where a professional needs to guide them through. Since the vaccine is safe, I personally get it once a year. I rather face the incredible low risk of side effects from said safe vaccine than long covid, which I've seen strongly impacting the life of friends even younger than me. Seeing a young man who used to run marathons struggle going up stairs is pretty horrible.
0/0	Sure, if you want life long sickness, disease, and/or cancer.
0/0	Survivors of Covid-19 often have long term issues with heart and lung
0/0/0	Sweden didn't do anything, which is why they did so well. The biggest problem is that covid is a cold but we treated it like a flu. There is no cure for a cold. The vaccine didn't help, masks didn't help, lockdowns didn't help. Hubris was the other huge problem

If only the conspiracists actually understand this. This is neither a miracle nor something rushed it’s good old fashion hard work and scientific research.

I don’t know how medical professionals went from heroes to villains just because of a vaccine I spent New Year’s Eve having a screaming match with my family about the vaccine, and I still didn’t manage to convince them of the science behind it. Please be kind to one another! It’s totally understandable to be concerned or even scared of something new, but if you’re going to ask questions about the vaccine, you have to be willing to listen to the answers!!! Spread love not hatred
1/1	Thank you Gian! I have been telling people who I interact with to get vaccinated. There is simply no excuse for people to stay hesitant and act like everything is back to normal for them when they refuse to do what’s right. One day of pain the next day isn’t going to kill them.

1/1	Thank you for this explanation. I am pro-vaccination however as a person with an autoimmune disease I cannot help but wonder about the following: the mRNA vaccine teaches our cells to make their own Covid spike proteins that’s great innovative. But for a person with an autoimmune disease and therefore with a confused immune system that attacks its own host how do we know that once our immune system senses the spike proteins that are produced by our own cells it won’t identify only the spike proteins as a threat but out own cells that produce them as well? This could make a confused immune system as people with autoimmunity have keep attacking its own healthy cells even after the spike protein is destroyed therefore resulting in another debilitating autoimmune disease. Am I wrong? Am I right? I don’t know. Is just what I’m thinking. I’m definitely opened to your thoughts and I am aware that the virus might create the same reaction.
1/0	Thank you for this information. Everyone needs to choose what is right for you. If you choose not to get vaccinated against any of these, awesome for you. Me, I’m an educated, science believer and choose to follow my doctor’s recommendations.

1/0	Thankfully all my family and most of my friends remain without the toxic crap inside them. We have no need to worry about any reactions to it. None of us have been sick. Sadly the few I do know that are vaxed are not faring well. 8 dead, 1 stroke, 1 brain clot, 1 amputated leg, many weeping legs, nearly all have had covid at least once. I'm not saying vax caused it, but it's weird I know more unvaxed than vaxed and none of those things happened to a single unvaxed friend or family member since vax rollout.

1/1	Thanks for putting the attention on this. My hubby and I got our flu and covid vaccines in October. We grew up in the 50s and 60s and thank goodness our parents had us fully vaccinated. We had all our kids vaccinated in their childhood. I certainly hope the idea of getting rid of vaccines (like polio vax) is the thing that dies an early death. My father born in 1906 survived polio at the age of 6, with a leg left in a brace for the rest of his life. His two younger sisters were not as fortunate and both died from polio that same year.
1/1	Thanks for putting this together, I’ve tried to explain to numerous people that mRNA technology isn’t new, nor can it be considered untested, it’s just that it’s very recent that it’s been used in humans outside of trials and experiments. The technology has been used in some veterinary vaccines for about a decade.

1/1	Thanks to vaccines, we can finally return to some normalcy.
1/1	Thanks to vaccines, we can safely travel and gather again.
1/1	Thanks, antivaxxers, I just had an eyelid surgery put on 3month delay. You all are making everything worse
0/0	Thanks. But I'm still not going to get it. I'll return to normal life on my own. I don't need the government to look out for my health. Give me the facts and I'll do with the information as I please.
0/0/0	Thanks. You convinced me that this crap isn't safe.
1/0	That 2nd dose of Moderna really packs a wallop! I feel like I just went ten rounds in the ring against that Russian boxer from Rocky IV, lol.
0/0	That is because patriotism pushed back alot because we think that the covid 19 vaccine is nonsense and we don't trust it at all
1/1	That is great! I got my booster not too long ago. Never got any side effects from any of the vaccines and I pray for the same for you🙏
0/0	That is such BS. Just two weeks ago moderna said it had a 70% efficacy rate. Now all of a sudden it's 94%. Such a lie. It's all about those money sick bastards
1/1	That is why world must work together and help each other. Don't think that if it affects others won't affect you. Everyone is affected and we need to fight this together.
0/0	That is wishful thinking suckered.I nore my family will trust any do called vaccine anymore. Cause you know mot evil Spirit: Who knows what you Demons put into it
1/1	That man that said he would NoT get a vaccine after getting covid. Sir: Why did you go to the hospital and take up space then ?
1/1	That microchip are the most stupidest conspiracy ever, the other conspiracy are stupid as well, but the microchip are absolute insane
1/0	That question "why did so many survive without the vaccine" is misleading on its face. Typical for people who don't understand math. They tend to think in black and white all or nothing.
1/1	That said, I am very pro COVID vaccine (for myself only bc diff people may have diff situation), and have gotten all of them. After all, infection has risks too --including Bell's Palsy. I'm sorry you've had to go through that and glad to read that you have mostly recovered.
0/0	That the spike protein is “harmless” is highly debatable.
0/0	That vaccine ain't going to do shit people needs to start and read the Bible and go back to God (my opinion)
0	That vaccine ruined my immune system. I will never take another vaccine of any kind. These people were smart. Thanks President Trump.
1/1	That was quick... Very insightful video! Hopefully the pandemic starts to end as more people get vaccinated!
0/0	That whole thing was so ridiculous…people got the injection to protect themselves. But they bullied those that chose not to have it because they where young and fit mostly. They wanted to catch it to gain natural immunity. So why have the jab if your gonna catch it from those that could catch it 😜 PS: you need to produce more proof of your News. This is why the right wing does so well they research and show evidence etc.
0/0	That why I refused to take the western vaccine
0/0	That will never happen. No government, no man, through edict or by threat will force me to take anything.
1/1	That woman crying over kids being vaccinated was the most ridiculous thing. Children having their rights taken away? Like they already had rights in that area to begin with! Parents are legally able to make all medical decisions for children. So if a kid wants a vaccine but their parent won’t do it, they’re shit out of luck. I hope she never becomes a nurse. She’s clearly not learned anything.
0/0	That word pandemic was promoted and repeated by them, not us.
0/0	That'd be a huge Nope for me.
1/1	That's been pretty educational and informative. I hope Blackos' message will open unvaccinated people's eyes to how import getting vaccinated against COVID really is.
0/0	That's disgusting!! How can this still be going on with all the truths coming out now!!
1/1	That's great news my 94 year old dad had the Pfizer vaccine.
1/1	That's normal, it can take a time before your body is ready to build antibodies, it will come good again.
1/1	That's really good news (from my German point of view). Regarding the anti-vaxxers I think that this will be more like pro "let me test on my own what a covid-19 infection does to me". If you ask me, we will again buy lots of toilet paper somewhen in September when the first traveller's came back with something beyond the delta variant. I hope I am wrong.
0/0	That's the elites plan to kill the poor people off!
0/0	That's the neat part IT DON'T.
1/1	That's the normal side effects of the vaccine. Believe me, some days of feeling sick id way better than having to en entubed in a ventilator, and possibly die.
0/0	That's the problem they feel it is safe. I want to know it is safe. There is a differance.
1/1	That's the safest way! The vaccine helps, but this strain is very powerful.
1/1	That's what studies are for. In cases like this, where the virus changed, you can look at current numbers of infected/hospitalized/dead by vaccination status and estimate how effective the vaccination is against infection/serious illness/death as the numbers from the original studies are obsolete now. Against the latter two it's still very effective and those are the ones that count most.
0/0	That's why I'm not vaccinated
0/0	That's why you signed a waver that they are not responsible for any damages..should have been a red flag for everyone.
0/0	Thats funny.. i expected you all to talk about the Bell's Palsy, facial paralysis and death.
0/1	That’s an easy question. Show us the double blind, peer reviewed placebo studies of the regular vaccines. There aren’t any.
1/-1	That’s basically how drug trials work… you can’t just say ‘well prove it isn’t effective’. The thought of it is like a Monty Python sketch…
0/0	That’s because vaccines usually take up to 10 years to develop and this one was developed & released within a year. So people are obviously suspicious. No long term studies.
0/0	That’s nice but My child will never get it
1/1	That’s pretty cool. Thanks to the Moderna vaccine my doctor discovered my cancer that I had lived with for 4 whole years and it was removed last year. So this vaccine means more to me than just protection against a virus..!
1/1	That’s the Mammy fully vaccinated today. #Moderna #vaccination ???? https://t.co/LfNFnmlYTQ
0/0	That’s very reassuring - tell that to the families of those who have died as a result of complications from vaccination
0/0	The "Ban the jab" resolution passed with a majority vote in the Lee County Republican Party and will now head to Governor Ron DeSantis' desk.
0/0	The "benefits" _do not_ outweigh the "risks" of a disease that is a minor inconvenience for the vast majority of the population.
0/0	The "spike protein is harmless"? I don't think so.
0/0	The "vaccine" killed more than "COVID"
0/0	The "vaccines" didn't stop ppl getting sick, NOR transmitting it to others. By the time they came out, the most susceptible had already gotten it, and built up antibodies, or passed away.
0/0	The &quot;lockdown&quot; protocols were established by teams of behavioral psychologists, historians, and anthropologists... and not virologists, immunologists, and epidemiologists as one would expect in a &quot;viral outbreak/pandemic&quot;.<br><br>Think about that one for a bit!
0/0	The 'Covid crisis' caused by the deliberate and planned release of a bio-weapon thereby enabling the injection of billions of people with a pathogenic bio-weapon (the fake 'Covid vaccines') was planned by all major governments many years in advance. 28
1/1	The 2024–25 COVID-19 vaccine is updated to better protect against variants that are currently spreading
0/0	The Amish people dont vaccinate at all and their kids are the healthiest kids of the world..
1/1	The AstraZeneca vaccine causing blood clots?! What such nonsense! ? My mother had her shot of it two weeks ago and only got a headache and fatigue after it, and is now right as rein! ? #CovidVaccine #oxfordastrazeneca
0/0	The Body Was Designed To HEAL ITSELF! Why in the world would You Interfere with that process? I Myself would rather go Straight to the Source. Whether I’m getting it From You or a Needle; I’m Still Getting It. I’ve had Symptoms in 2020. People with Multiple Jabs are getting this Multiple Times, go figure.
0/1	The C19 vaccine ruined my life ! There is no way in hell I’ll ever get any other vaccine. Never. EVER!
0/0	The CDC is in bed with big pharma. Gates and Fauci make huge profits from a "pandemic" through patents/vaxxes ect..... There is no money in natural immunity(freedom) or holistic treatments that are proven. In fact holistic meds have been suppressed going back to the 1950s(Rockefeller). Do the math and see how the matrix works. Wake up coppertop!! This is how the 1% stay in control. Authority should never dictate truth, but that has been the norm for 1000s of years ;) peace
0/0	The CDC keeps changing its recommendations—why trust them?
0/0	The CDC lied about masks and now they’re lying about vaccines. Do your own research!
0/-1	The CDC messaging was abysmal and WHO was worse.
1/1	The COVID 19 vaccine is actually recommended during pregnancy. The high fever and blood flow restrictions associated with COVID 19 significantly increase the likelihood of adverse fetal impacts. This is why pregnant women are currently advised to get the vaccine. Below are studies from recent years, including a swedish cohort study. There is no evidence currently showing the vaccine negatively impacts mom or baby, and plenty of evidence showing that getting COVID is very bad for both Mom and baby. Adding a study that shows that getting COVID in your first trimester significantly increases your risk of major congenital malformations. The way to avoid getting COVID is to get vaccinated. Tl;Dr Getting COVID in the first trimester= Very bad. Getting the vaccine in the first trimester = probably not getting COVID + nothing else bad.
1/1	The COVID specific tests had good quality data for safety and efficacy
1/1	The COVID vaccine does work. It’s very safe and effective. No one thought COVID would be barred from entering your body. It just lessens the effects of a future infection
1/1	The COVID vaccine gave me peace of mind. Totally worth it!
0/0	The COVID vaccine is a killer.
1/1	The COVID vaccine is a tool that helps human evolution. Those low-IQ people who don't believe in it have died.
1/1	The COVID vaccine is such a relief! I’ve been feeling a little anxious about the virus, but now that I’m vaccinated, I feel a lot more confident going out and doing things. The process was incredibly fast, and I was in and out of the vaccination site in no time. The best part is knowing that I’m now protected from severe illness. I’m so grateful for the hard work that went into developing the vaccine and for the healthcare professionals who’ve been making this process smooth for everyone.
1/1	The COVID vaccine isn’t perfect, but at least it doesn’t leave you hooked up to a ventilator.
1/1	The COVID vaccines (like seat belts in cars) do not provide 100% protection. But they reduce your chance of dying from COVID by a factor of about 65.
1/1	The COVID vaccines are fine.
1/1	The COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant global challenge, the vaccines against it have been developed and recommended based on extensive research and clinical trials conducted by scientists and medical professionals. The goal is to encourage protective measures to save lives and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. It’s natural to feel overwhelmed by something new but focusing on evidence-based sources can help us make informed decisions.
0/0	The COVID-19 vaccine doesn't slow transmission because under the CDC's new "vaccine" definition it doesn't have to. It only mitigates side-effects. If side effects from the shot are worst than the side effects of COVID-19, it is not necessary.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine has allowed businesses to reopen safely, helping the economy recover while keeping people protected. It’s a win-win for everyone.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine has been a game-changer for me. I can finally travel and see my family without constant worry.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine has been a lifeline for small businesses like mine. It’s helping us recover and rebuild after a tough year.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine has been tested rigorously. I have full confidence in its safety.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine has given me a renewed sense of hope.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine helped me avoid severe illness. Grateful!
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a tool that will allow us to get back to our lives and normal activities.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is critical for public safety, and I’m fully on board with it.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be the most effective and sustainable approach for controlling the pandemic.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is one of the greatest medical achievements of our lifetime. I’m proud to be a part of history by getting vaccinated.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is saving millions of lives worldwide. It’s incredible to see how science can provide hope and solutions in times of crisis
1/1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is truly a marvel of modern science. The speed at which it was developed, without compromising safety, shows how far medicine has come.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine isn’t a magic cure, but it’s our best shot at keeping people safe.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been one of the most significant public health achievements of our time. It’s history in the making!
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine saved my family from severe illness.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine saved my life. I had a mild case, but without the vaccine, it could have been much worse. I'm grateful for the science behind it.
0/0	The Covid 19 vaccine has killed a lot of people in this so called country. Big Pharma paid bonuses to political leaders that supported their toxic vaccines.
1/1	The Covid 19 vaccine is free, hospital stays and funerals cost big bucks. I do not like having to attend funerals for my relatives and friends
1/1	The Covid injection is said to be a safe medicine.
0/0/0	The Covid propaganda continues
0/0	The Covid vaccine exposed the lengths to which big pharma would go to peddle their wares and it has made me skeptical of vaccines and new meds.
0/0	The Covid vaccine is killing my mother . She has been non stop to the hospital since she has gotten the shots. I warned her to never get it but these assholes wants to keep brainwashing people and pressuring them, pressured until they couldn’t take it anymore. The healthcare industry and the government all work together and it’s nothing but a fkn joke, playing with humanity, trying to end humans with whatever the fuck it is they are putting in those vaccines! Why on earth do we need an injection of Covid in us to make our immune system stronger? How about you keep that shit far away from our blood stream. Make it make sense! Our immune system is meant fight off whatever disease, bacteria viruses and all the crap, but they want to directly inject Covid into us 😂😂. I’m healthier than most I can definitely say that I have never needed to vaccinate to get that healthy life. Stop trying to be apart of something that’s not really there. If you’re vaccinated then you’re just a damn puppet to this world and you have no control of your own life. It’s pathetic
0/0	The Covid vaccine is unsafe. No one should be forced to get it. In fact it should be taken off the market.
0/0	The Covid vaccine scheme is untenable. Bivalent shots are the only ones available. They were only tested in 8 mice even though there are no known correlates of protection. They target variants that no longer exist. Forcing this toxic junk on vulnerable people is a crime
1/1	The Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective.
0/-1	The DOJ under Trump will drop the lawsuit and Trump will pay all service members forced out under Biden. Trump loves them. He went to a very important military academy growing up. Worst thing I saw ( go find it ) video of soldier in a stockade and about 6-7 soldiers rushed in threw him to the ground hog tied his hands and feet while all these guy were crushing him! Why? He wouldn't take the vax and they either were trying to inject him or take covid test!
1/-1	The Delta variant is more contagious so why do you want to take it on? Do you want this pandemic to be never ending??
0/0	The Democrats don’t like RFK Jr. because of his apprehension on vaccines. The Democrats pushed the COVID-19 gene therapy shot as totally safe. I wish RFK Jr. was around back then. My health has been horrible ever since getting those shots. The Democrats and Biden lied to us.
0	The FDA is a joke. And the joke is on us. The FDA is an evil government organization.
1/1	The FDA just fully approved the Pfizer vaccine. If your excuse to not get it was because “it’s experimental” then looks like you don’t have an excuse anymore
0/0	The Freemasons should stop their vaccination program.
1/1	The Government should announce that anyone not vaccinated without good reason will not be given NHS treatment for Covid. It would cut hospital admissions dramatically.
0/0/0	The H and V in this HMPV is calculated to scare you. You are scared of HIV. So you will be scared of this thing... I'm not taking any vaccine
0/0/0	The Homeless were seemingly unaffected. Amazing.
1/1	The ICUs were overwhelmed, and medical staff were exhausted. This could have been avoided if more people got vaccinated. 😡
0/0	The Johnson & Johnson covid vaccine has been discontinued. Hmmmm. I wonder why.
1/1	The Moderna and Pfizer messagener RNA vaccinations are by far The SAFEST and Most EFFECTIVE Vaccinations ever.
1/1	The Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine is 94.1% effective at protecting against symptomatic COVID-19 after administration of the second dose
1/1	The NIH says there is not one death certificate in U.S. that lists cause,of death as Covid vaccine!
1/0	The Nurse at the surgery tried to get me to have it when I went in for a check up. I said I will take it, in about 10 years time when there have been proper studies done. The fact people call us vaccine deniers etc is ridiculous. I have vaccines but they have all been tested over years or decades. This has been hardly test at all, and only on a handful of mice when it was. Even the companies say they don't know if it's effective. I chose not to be a guinea pig in the testing phase, as this is a mass worldwide testing phase and nothing more. And then you have big tech censoring Dr's. Nurses and virologists who say the opposite to what the mainstream is, WHY in a Democracy would anything like this be censored? everything that has been opposed in the past has always been allowed to be voiced because the truth wins out. But when censorship begins I start to refrain.
0/0	The Only Vax to ever be allowed to bypass Animal testing - Thats means YOU are the guinea pig , they also Know that this causes you to be extremely Vulnerable to any New Virus!!!! FACTS-
1/1	The Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine. Even 14 days after the first shot, you can see a separation of the treatment (blue) vs placebo (red) groups, with 95% reduction in new infections in vaccinated group. This is a very effective vaccine
1/1	The Pfizer and mRNA vaccines have gone through rigorous studies to ensure they are as safe as possible. They do NOT contain preservatives, formaldehyde, mercury, egg, fetal cells or microchips!
0/0/0	The Pfizer documents had some shady stuff in them…
1/0	The Pros for Johnson and Johnson there profit is gong to skyrocket And they will make sure the consumer can't sue them
1/-1	The Republican Party, famous for screaming “Trust the science !” claiming COVID vaccines kill people in droves, and then turn around and tell you humans don’t contribute to global warming. Incredible ignorance.
0/0/0	The Risk should be MY DECISSION.
1/-1/1	The SARS family has been around for a very long time, the vaccine has essentially been in development for nearly 20 years.
1/1	The Sinovac vaccine was mediocre in general and especially so compared to the MRNA ones which were excellent. It probably wouldn't have been approved in the US. It was better than nothing and was still fairly effective at preventing death though.
0/0	The Truth about Viruses: Viruses are a product of the Earths ecological cycles. They regulate the planets ecosystems and evolve life forms. The Earth also produces Humans. Human populations are also regulated by the planet in order to maintain our ecosystems. Vaccines are not naturally occurring they don’t adapt and change like our bodies immune system and some people only care about getting rich
1/1	The U.S. was vaccinating an average of 1.7 million Americans per day this week, and had administered at least one dose to more than 12 per cent of its population as of Friday. Best news ever.
1/-1	The US has like a surplus of vaccines and are even giving people incentives to get vaccinated, meanwhile in my country people are are trying their hardest to get vaccinated cause of scarcity. What a world we live in.
0/0	The V* wasn’t just to make someone sick it to separate you from God.
0	The Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS) was used to measure participants’ hesitancy levels to get vaccines in general.
1/1	The Vaccine is safe. Take a look at the thousands of people who got it. Were completely fine. Would you rather get the vaccine and MAYBE have some small and harmless side effects or not get it and be at greater risk of getting the virus and dying.
1/1	The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that everyone get vaccinated against COVID-19
1/1	The ability to spew lies for views has created the antivax movement.
1/1	The accessibility of the vaccine in my area has been excellent.
0/0	The adverse side effects aren’t being tracked or reported! That’s all I need to know!
1	The amount of nonsense floating around about vaccines is mind-blowing. Read a real study!
0/0	The amount of people ready and willing to except "science" because the government said so is wild. Any critical thinkers are automatically marked "conspiracy theorists". All you have to do is follow the money.
1/1	The amount of prideful, selfish and bratty stupidity of these kind of people is mind blowing
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0/0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn’t get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! Best of luck, they’re definitely gonna need it.
0/0	The animals they tested it on died!!
0/0	The answer is - we shouldn't. If people don't want to get vaccinated, that's their choice. Government shouldn't force them to.
0/0	The answer is HELL NO! None of the Covid vaccines have been tested for safety and they have negative efficacy. No one should ever take that shot.
1/1	The anti-vaccinationists are, as always, drunk or high on other drugs, they do not notice the progress in medicine
1/1	The anti-vax and conservative communities look for anything to support their ridiculous beliefs that vaccinations don't work. Their sole purpose is to seek out anything to validate their own beliefs, doesn't matter what the CDC says or does. These communities are hotbeds of unfounded or misinterpreted information for the purpose of validating their belief system.
1/1/1	The anti-vaxxers can stare a global pandemic in the face and just pretend it's all a ploy to track people through vaccines. Holy shit guys, God needs to shake the etch-a-sketch and start over.
1/1	The anti-vaxxers stand as proof of how good we have it here in America. Many people have forgotten, and many more have never known, a time without vaccines. In a place where things like smallpox and polio have been eradicated, people don’t realize how deadly these diseases can be. But those of us over here who study history can draw a clear line in infant mortality rates before versus after the introduction of vaccines.
1/1	The antivax crowd keeps talking about vaccine side effects but ignores the far worse effects of preventable diseases.
1/1	The antivax movement is sickening.
1/1	The antivax people keep bringing up the side effects of the vaccinations but what about the side effects of the diseases that their children could get as a result of not receiving the vaccinations? The diseases that they are putting their children up at risk for receiving are far worse than any side effect the vaccinations could ever cause. This really shouldn't even be up for discussion.
1/1	The antivax people keep bringing up the side effects of the vaccinations but what about the side effects of the diseases that their children could get as a result of not receiving the vaccinations? The diseases... are far worse than any side effect the vaccinations could ever cause.
1/1	The article says that vaccines using an inactivated virus is safer than those using live attenuated virus. the vaccines of Sinovac and Sinopharm use an inactivated virus.
0/0	The backlash against vaccinations, one of the best tools humanity has developed to increase lifespans, is just an indicator of how strong the anti-intellectual movement has become because of social media.
0/-1	The bald woman scared me out of getting the jab.
0/0	The beginning of the video is completely inaccurate. The reason it takes 5- 7 years to make a vaccine is not the time it takes to discover an effective one but the time it takes to adequately trial it in animals and then in humans. The time taken in trials ensures that any short, medium and longer term adverse effects have time to occur and can evaluated before classing the vaccine as safe for use in the general population. The Covid 19 vaccine itself was produced quickly because much of the development work had already been done when trying to develop vaccines for SARS and MERS in the early 2000s. The Covid 19 vaccine was produced in around 11 months and is cleared for use under emergency authorization powers. That in itself should inform us that it has been brought into use without being adequately trialed for a long enough period in animals and humans.
0/0	The benefits don’t outweigh the risks! You can still get it and transmit it. It’s novel and the mfg even know they “ worked at the speed of science” so how careless that there isn’t full transparency about side effects to this day.
0/0	The benefits far outweigh the risks?…NO IT DOES NOT!…well, maybe the risk they’re talking about is that big pharmaceutical companies will not make billions of dollars !
1/1	The benefits greatly outweigh the risks.
1/0	The benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh any potential risks.

1/-1	The best decision I’ve made all year!
1/1	The best decision I’ve made during this pandemic period was to get vaccinated.
1/1	The best decision I’ve made this year!
0/0	The best defense against disease is a healthy, strong immune system, not overloaded with toxins from food, water, air, and pharmaceutical products.
1/1	The best part about being vaccinated is not having to live in fear anymore. I feel safer in public spaces and can enjoy life more freely.
0/0	The best part of being a anti vaxer is getting up this morning not needing to worry about Myocarditis, ", Turbo cancer"{a street term for having a fart crossways and discovering ya got stage 4}, water on your heart?, or spike protein in your brain and big toe, which was said to stay localized. You boys "soft shoe" the situation because of your position in medicine. I dislike the term "RARE". Junk science in junk science out.
0/0	The best part of being an anti vaxxer is that I don't end up with blood clots and myocarditis
1/1	The best quality vaccines!
0/0	The best thing about not having gotten the experimental injections is that I didn't get myocarditis, pericarditis, neurological damage, mysterious blood clots, some rapid growing cancer, an auto immune condition, or sudden death. So far natural immunity is my friend though.
1/1	The best vaccine is the one you are offered.
0/0	The best way to an early grave
1/0	The best way to inmunicing you must vaccinating
1/1	The best way to protect yourself is to vaccinate. It won’t stop you from being exposed, but if you are and if you get sick, it won’t be nearly as severe.
0/1	The biggest regret in my life was giving into the push to be vaxxed ,,,,if I didn't I wouldn't have a job and starvation would have killed me instead.
1/1	The biggest side affect of the shots for my family is we haven't been sick, not even a cold for two years and I have kids in elementary school.
1/1	The booster after my covid case that gave me long covid helped my LC and actually took away a symptom, I've had like 6 boosters since then with the most mild reactions coming from Novavax. Novavax needs to be more available to people and used more often.
1/1	The booster shot made a huge difference for me. I didn’t get sick even when everyone around me had COVID.
0/0	The censorship around questioning the vaccine is scary.
0/0	The censorship around vaccine concerns makes me even more suspicious.
1/1	The choice is yours. Feel free to remain unvaccinated and thus vulnerable to circulating disease.
1/1	The comments are disgusting and incredibly insulting. As someone who has autism, and for many years have used the disability I and many others live with every day who have been used as propaganda by anti-vaxxers just makes me feel worthless. You're putting your kids at risk because you decided to listen to Wendy on Facebook, rather than the medical professionals.
1/1	The comments are so asinine. The side effects are readily available and mild. They sound like the people that told me vaccines gave my daughter autism.
1/1	The community provides special transportation services for elderly residents, making it more convenient for them to get vaccinated.
0/0	The constant vaccine marketing makes it feel like we’re being forced into something we don’t want to do.
0/0	The corporate product is so safe and effective it required threats, intimidation, coercion and ostracism to convince consumers to consume it.
1/0	The covid "vaccines" provide demontrably no benefits whatsoever to anyone under 80. Look at the numbers needed to treat to prevent a serious outcome vs chance of serious side effects.
1/1	The covid vaccine does not cause higher rates of miscarriage or complications, but getting covid may. The best way to protect your baby right now is to protect yourself. It sounds like if you wait until your second trimester, you wouldn’t be protected for the first few months of cold and flu season - the time you’re at the highest risk for infection. The vaccine is recommended now so that you’ll be protected before your family gatherings, holiday parties, etc. Anecdotally, I got my flu and covid vaccines this year at 8 weeks pregnant and had zero complications, I’m now 10 weeks. I feel more relaxed knowing I have some protection from infections that could harm my baby as we head into winter.
0/0	The covid vaccine hasn’t been tested . Anyone taking the poison shot ... is part of the trial!
0/0	The covid vaccine was a HOAX. Any person who has a brain can see that by now.
0/0	The covid vaccine was a total fraud, by the time it rolled out we were on Omicron, even Bill Gates admitted Omicron was basically a "vaccine" you can look it up. The mRNA technology is deeply flawed, this has been proven in multiple studies MSN has ignored. It has killed millions
1/1	The covid vaccine was safe, effective, and never had a single side effect. I
1/1	The covid vaccines were safe and effective.
1/1	The covid vaccines were safe and effective. Get over it.
0/0	The covid-19 vaccines were all made rushed. This questions me of the side effects and the irreversible damage it could do to our health. Take at your own risk.
0/0	The crazy part is when you start thinking about who’s bossing around 3 former presidents and getting them to stand like kids in a school project delivering these scripts
1/0	The current study did not examine other potential reasons for participants believing in mis/disinformation of COVID-19 vaccines other than their inaccurate knowledge.
1/1	The currently available #Covidvaccine are safe and effective, i got #pfizer &amp; both my elderly parents got #Moderna with NO SIDE EFFECTS! Even when side effects occur, they are a magnitude less then getting #COVID19!!! So #GetTheShot #GetVaccinated, Please!
1/1	The data doesn’t lie vaccinated people have way lower hospitalization rates.
1/1	The data is clear. Fully vaccinated persons have a 3.2 x lower risk of contracting COVID 14.9x lower risk of death from COVID So Ron Johnson is correct that it doesn't PREVENT COVID. The vaccine does what every other vaccine does, lowers your risk of bad outcomes.
1/1	The data is clear. vaccines save lives.
1/1	The data is clear: vaccinated people have better outcomes.
1/1	The data is clear: vaccines drastically reduce hospitalizations and deaths
1/1	The data is clear: vaccines reduce hospitalizations by over 90%. So go to get a shot.
1/1	The data is out there. Hospitalized COVID patients were mostly unvaxxed.
0/-1	The data on side effects is being covered up. I won’t trust something so non-transparent.
1/1	The data overwhelmingly supports the benefits of COVID vaccines.
1/1	The data overwhelmingly supports the benefits of vaccination.
1/1	The data show that the vaccines were not only extremely safe (especially the mRNA ones), but extremely effective.
0/0	The data shows that the more of this drug you take the more harm it does. That's exactly what you'd expect with any poison.
1/1	The day I got vaccinated, I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders; it wasn’t just about protecting myself, but about contributing to a safer community for everyone.
1/-1	The day you take a public stand on something, is that day you that you lose your right to claim to be a victim, and the stand you've taken proves to be incorrect. You're not a victim, you're a willing party who chose your path.
0/0	The death from Covid numbers were inflated. The cdc have already admitted to it
1/1/1	The decision to get vaccinated was easy once I considered the benefits. The whole process was quick and painless, and the staff at the clinic were so kind and professional. I’ve had minimal side effects, just a little soreness in my arm for a day. Now, I feel like I’m part of the solution, helping reduce the spread of the virus and protect those around me. I strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated so we can all move forward together.
1/1	The development of the vaccine proves that when the world unites for a cause, we can achieve incredible things. It’s a true scientific triumph!
1/1	The difference is that advocates of vaccination, and most in the center and left, are taking an empathic position. Vaccination opponents are taking a selfish position.
0/1	The disgusting part is that we STILL get advertising promoting "vaccine" boosters!
1/1	The doctor explained that common side effects of the vaccine are usually mild and completely manageable.
1/1	The doctor said that the chances of adverse reactions after vaccination are very low, and most people are safe.
0/1	The doctors continue to tell her that they can’t tell her why she developed the disease but she told her niece she knows it’s the vaccine
1/1	The doctors were so patient and collected. I was very impressed.
1/-1	The downstream responses to this tweet are insane. EVERYONE should understand that vaccines don't make themselves. That it takes dedicated scientists backed by large quantities of money in order to accelerate their work. Where does this insanity come from?
0/1	The dumbest thing about people that think vaccines are a government conspiracy is that they’re arguing against something that works since it eradicated polio and small pox. Like if you wanted to control the population why would step one be saving millions and millions of lives with the miracles of modern medicine?
0/0	The duration, the side effects, the unknown! Stay away!
1/1	The education system is so bad in the USA they have no idea what DNA is '' its completely wiped out our DNA '' ... nuts
1/1/1	The effect is remarkable, should have all, not at all ambiguous, used to say good!
1/1	The effectiveness of any vaccine depends on the traits of the next round of mutations expected to arise in the next few months. At this point, no one knows which vaccine will match those strains better. Anecdotally it's impressive that the Novavax is effective against some current variants.
0/1	The effects of the Pfizer jabs were worse than the effects of Omicron for me. After each shot, I felt like a brain dead and fatigued zombie who was recovering from a moderately severe concussion for 5 days. With Omicron, I just had some night sweats(no chills just more sweat while sleeping), sneezed 20 times, and had a periodically mild runny nose. I was still able to exercise with omicron but not so after each vaccine shot. So no booster for me!
1/1	The elderly should get it first along with Healthcare workers and First Responders. After that then everyone else from oldest to the youngest.
1/1/1/1	The emergency Covid vaccine rollout was a giant success Look how global Covid deaths PLUMMETED in early 2022. That was largely because of vaccines. Don't rewrite history!
0/-1	The entire system is corrupt. Absolutely no one is held responsible for anything, anymore.
1/1	The fact is, the long term side affects from covid are much worse than the vaccine.
0/0	The fact it says MOST people and USUAL..NORMALLY.....vague words.. do people really not see the bigger picture with the vaccine?!...
1/1	The fact she said it could be altering her genetics indicates she has no clue what she is talking about or even what DNA is.
0/0	The fact that boosters are already being recommended makes me feel like the vaccine doesn't work as well as they said it would.
0/0	The fact that companies AREN'T liable for damages... should tell you everything you need to know.
1/1	The fact that health care workers are getting it first leads me to believe it will be even more refined by the time the rest of us can get it. So yes, as I have family in the medical field, I trust that they won't let it past them if anything is wrong with it.
1/-1	The fact that incarcerated criminals will get the vaccine before me and other law abiding citizens shows how messed up this country is.
1/1	The fact that people are looking for a middle ground on this issue is disgusting. Vaccines save lives, end of story. We need to use them to prevent children from dying from preventable diseases.
0/0	The fact that people aren’t even allowed to question the vaccine makes me more suspicious than anything else.
1/1	The fact that she's alive is massive evidence of how far modern medicine has come. Without modern medicine natural selection would have weeded out people like her decades ago.
0	The fact that some countries have paused certain vaccines due to safety concerns makes me hesitant to get any of them.
0/0	The fact that the covid drugs quite obviously failed to offer immunity to anything, renders the term "anti vaxxer” moot.
0/0	The fact that the health industry loves to push death and harmful products so they can keep themselves in business is disgraceful and immoral. the people that inject the vaccine into the masses are the ones that need to be held accountable as well for the harm and murder they are committing with a rush to public cure for 99.95% survivable virus.
0/0	The fact that the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission makes me question its usefulness.
0/0	The fact that the vaccine was developed so quickly makes me question its safety.
0/0	The fact that they silenced experts who spoke out should concern you.
0/0	The fact that they’re forcing this on people while suppressing real treatment options should tell you everything.
0/0/0/0	The fact that they’re trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
0/0	The fact that vaccine manufacturers aren't liable for adverse effects makes me distrustful of the whole process.
1/1	The fact that we developed a vaccine this fast is a testament to human ingenuity. Science wins again!
0/0	The fact that you think the Covid shot is anything like a real vaccine tells me you just described yourself.They literally changed the definition.Peer reviewed studies means nothing now after Covid. They were wrong on everything and just spewing what big Pharma paid them to say.
0/0	The fact theyre still administering this snake oil blows my mind
0/0	The fact you are unable to sue the company’s if damages Happen is all I need to know
1/1	The factual science facts of 'Why was this vaccine ready so quickly' is interesting... SARS vaccines in particular and mRNA stuff in general were worked on for decades before COVID-19 hit.
0/0	The family next door got their COVID vaccines early, yet they all ended up with severe cases.
1/1	The faster people get vaccinated, the fewer mutations the virus can develop.
1/1/1	The faster we all get vaccinated, the sooner we can end this pandemic.
1/1	The faster we vaccinate, the sooner we can enjoy life without restrictions
1/1	The findings set the Moderna vaccine up for FDA authorization by the end of this week, meaning Americans could soon have two highly effective Covid-19 vaccines.
1/1/1	The first time I had COVID, that I know of anyway, was in 2022, so after both my shots, and messed me up for two weeks. The second time I got it, last year, I barely had symptoms.
1/1/1	The first time I had covid was before the vaccines were available and I was sick for about a month, then had long covid issues for nearly 6 months after that. After vaccination when I get it I only get sick for about a week then feel normal. I never want to go back to that first time, it was truly terrifying to be that sick.
1/1	The first vaccination I had was the Salk vaccine against polio. I have had vaccinations since then every time the risk from the disease was worst than the risks from the vaccine. I have had both Covid vaccinations. To date including flu shots I have received 50 vaccinations. I have had zero negative affects from the vaccinations.
1/1	The first vaccine was created centuries ago. Imagine if people back then refused it. We’d still be fighting smallpox.
1/-1	The flat earthers of heath care
0/0	The flu vaccine has not stopped the flu. Why are they trying to push this vaccine. It will not stop the Covid virus either. Follow the money.
1/1	The four vaccines recommended during pregnancy— #flu, #Tdap, #RSV and #COVID—greatly lower the risk of illness for both you and your baby. Talk to your practitioner about when to get #vaccinated during #pregnancy.
0	The funny thing is Nazarin could have asked her the same question back. "How can you be sure that it wasn't the vaccine?"
0/0	The global rollout is happening so fast—who’s really behind this? It’s suspicious.
0/0	The global stats don't lie... all country's graphs jumped through the roof for convid numbers and deaths directly AFTER rollouts. Sad, but true.
1/1	The goal was always to end the pandemic. The vaccine is how we do that.
0/0	The govenment wants you to get vaccinated so bad but refuses to give out insulin for free

0/0	The government lied too many times for me to trust them now.
0/-1	The government needs to get out of our business. We need to stop paying taxes until they knock it off
1/1	The government provides free vaccines, so we should take advantage of this opportunity and get vaccinated.
0/0	The government says we should prioritize healthy eating yet they still allow unhealthy restaurants to be in business and support tobacco/drugs ("medical marijuana") and alcohol. So the government says we should all get a vaccination even though it's not fully tested to be effective, even if we have no comorbidities and are fully able to practice hygiene and masking if we choose.
0/-1	The government should not control what goes into our bodies.

0/-1	The greater the hype - hysteria & scaremongering, the less I believe it.
1/1	The greatest enemy of life saving vaccines is misinformation. The anti mandate Albert's govt has released a $4 million ideologically driven report that has shocked doctors and researchers for its scientific shortcomings. Misinformation at a very high level.
1/1	The guy who published the study stating vaccines are bad apologized and retracted his paper.
1/1	The guys that made the vaccines are absolute legends and i applaud them.
0/0	The harder they push the more I resist.
0/0	The harm this vaccine technology has caused is vast. So many have been left with permanent damage, it's so tragic.
0/0	The health care sector is disgusting
1/1	The helmet is only 98% safe so we shouldn't use it
1/1	The high number of vaccinated people in intensive care in NSW may appear concerning but it actually shows the jab is working.
1/1	The hospital I work for just went a full week with no new COVID cases among staff for the first time since Feb 2020. Very cool to see the vaccine in action. Edit: This is with 75% of employees having received one dose and 65% having received both doses.
1/1	The hospitals were overflowing with COVID patients. Most were unvaccinated. That tells you everything you need to know. 🚑
0/0	The human body has its very own antibodies to keep the body healthy. No need to be jabbed with toxic poison
1/1	The hundreds/thousands of families who have children who died from Covid or were severely affected by long-term Covid complications in their children are the reason we want the vaccination for our kids as soon as it becomes available to them.
1/1	The husband has got his first vaccine shot of #Covaxin today. Last year this time we were full of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and slight despair. One year is a long time for getting partial relief.
0/0	The idea of vaccine passports makes me uncomfortable
1/1	The idea that the Covid vaccines 'didn't work' is a myth that has taken hold.
0/0	The immune system is finely balanced, delicate and very efficient the last thing it needs is it’s T cells etc constantly bombarded.
1/1	The inablity to understand science (and therefore why and how vaccines work) is no proof against it!
1/1	The incidence of depression in the four weeks after a Covid-19 diagnosis was 1.93 times higher in people who had Covid before vaccinations were available, 1.79 times higher among the unvaccinated group and 1.16 times higher among the vaccinated group, the researchers found. The study is simply stating that having covid doubles the chances of having depression and that vaccinations reduce the risk significantly.
1/1	The ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are safe.
1/-1	The ingridients for the vaccines are oline lol
0/-1	The inside of the body is nothing less than an action movie
1/1	The intelligent people already trust the science

1/1	The introduction of vaccines has made us see the beauty of life again.
1/1	The irony that this comment section is full of conspiracy theorists!
0/0	The issue with the COVID vaccine is that it's not a vaccine. It's an experimental gene therapy. Even using the word therapeutic is a bit too generous. It's really just an experimental injection that catastrophically failed and caused incredible harm
0/0	The jab is for the sheep .
0/0	The jab is q killer drug to wipe out man kind. Thousands of cases are in hospital every day cos of the jab. The jab is worse that cova 19
0/0	The jab is released for emergency use only, not fully tested, and DOES NOT stop transmission, that were assured of.

1/-1	The level of ignorance and lack of knowledge/education derived from the comments, has reached the moon!
1/1	The list of potential adverse side effects are long for each medicine already available to us. Because we are all different the effects they have are different for each of us. I’m amazed that scientists have come up with something so quickly. Technology we have as a world unit is incredible. There are so many other advances possible, we can help each other so much if we stop getting in our own way! Smile and laugh often!! It’s good for us all!
0/0	The list of vaccine ingredients is like chemical weapons. Who dares to inject these into children?
0/0	The long-term effects are unknown, and I won’t be a guinea pig.
0/0	The long-term effects of vaccines are unknown, so it's safer to avoid them
0/0	The long-term impact on fertility is unknown tho xd
0/0	The long-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccines are unknown.
0/0	The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab.
1/1	The low efficacy is primarily because the original vaccines were developed against the alpha strains (they are similarly less efficacious in adults). COVID is (I believe?) the third or fourth leading cause of death in kids under five so far this year (in the US). The vaccines carry risk but so does getting COVID - I want the odds stacked in my favor as much as possible.
1/1	The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine teaches your cells to make a harmless piece of the virus’s spike protein. This helps your immune system recognize and fight the virus if you’re exposed later. It doesn’t alter your DNA—just trains your body to protect itself.
0/-1	The mRNA shots failed to pass clinical trials in the past yet that's what they chose to roll with. What could go wrong?
1/1	The mRNA technology is a breakthrough!! Calls on mRNa
1/1	The major worries are a) allergic/autoimmune reactions, which are vanishingly rare, and b) swelling/redness/inflammation/fever, which are uncomfortable, but worthwhile in a tradeoff for protection from deadly diseases.
1/1	The majority of professional nurses, physicians and therapists have been vaccinated for some time. They know better.
1/1	The majority of the world got it, mass infertility has not happened, calm down.
0/0/1	The mandates would not have been such a problem had the vaccines themselves been less problematic.
1/1	The measles outbreaks prove we need vaccines. COVID vaccines are no different—trust the data.
0/-1	The media is exaggerating the need for vaccines.

1/1	The medical community's efforts in developing the vaccine have been incredible.
1/1/1	The mom who says that vaccines are safe-ish shouldn't use any medication I guess... ALL drugs have adverse effects even the most used medication so what's her point?
1/1	The moment that Canada lets me get it I’M RUSHING TO GET IT. Keep my parents, neighbours, and myself safe?! SIGN ME IMMEDIATELY UP. Also, in my head, the sooner I get it the faster we all get to go to the movies and bookstores again which is a LOVELY incentive!

1/1	The mortality and morbidity rates of COVID-19 are increasing rabidly a round the world and seems to be out of control, if vaccines are really produced a mass vaccination campaign is the must.
1/1	The most commonly shared vaccine misinformation was that COVID-19 vaccines contain a microchip to track people.

1/-1	The number of correctly answered statements was summed to assess knowledge levels of the COVID-19 vaccines
1/1	The only question parents should ask is “how quickly can I get an appointment for my child to get the vaccine”
0/0	The only question you need to ask yourself is was the vaccine developed for covid19 or was covid19 developed for the vaccine ?
1/1	The only reason my 3 yo isn’t vaccinated for it yet is I can’t currently afford the dr visit. As soon as I can he’s getting it
1/1	The only reason we have fewer COVID deaths is because of vaccines. It's not magic.
1/-1	The only side effect should be healthy people. "Potential side effects" is too general.

1/1	The only upside to anti-vaxxers is that they won’t be around much longer.
1/1	The only way there would be no side affect is to have a vaccine that was genetically engineered for an individual were not there yet but this the 21st century. I would be willing to take the vaccine.
1/1	The only way to get out from COVID is to get a vaccination

0/1	The peace of mind after getting vaccinated is invaluable.
0/0	The peer reviewed published study show that the more shots you got the more likely you were to get Covid. So better try again.
1/1	The people crying on here is funny, first its rare and how many adverse reactions do you think there is gonna be when the whole world gets vaccinated all at once, BILLIONS OF PEOPLE YALL ARE SO DUMB ITS MIND BLOWING, SOME OF THE FOOD YOU PUT IN YOURSELF EVERY IS WORSE

1/1	The people that didn't get the vaccine and didn't end up doing fine are not here anymore to comment on this. This whole thread will be 'I didn't get it and I'm just fine', just like someone that doesn't wear their seatbelt and has never been killed or seriously injured in a crash thinks seatbelts aren't important enough to wear. Survivorship bias is going to net you a lot of identical responses.

1/1	The popularity of vaccines has opened our eyes to the possibility of socializing again.
0/-1	The possibility of them integrating into the host cell genome is low. I had to play that back 3 times to make sure I heard it right. Low is not good enough.
1/1	The presently available vaccines are effective and safe. They work . There is no reason not to get vaccinated. If you don’t you are not only doing yourself a disservice but also abrogating your responsibility to support the common good.

0/-1	The pro vax hahahahhahahahahahaahhaa
0/1	The pro-vax people definitely did NOT research it.
0/0	The problem I have with the vaccination is that you're still vulnerable to COVID, but less severe...so regardless, no one is safe from getting it.
0/0	The problem I have with the vaccine is that it hasn't been given much time to test it, not enough studied, not enough time allowed. It seems like they made it in a week & then put it on the market. I am allergic to certain meds & l just can't take that risk.
0	The problem here is the longterm effect has not bee laid or still unknown..as these vaccine are still on trial phase and given emergency use autho..so for me safety is still blank..as per this video presentation it is really tricky and decietful as what the mRNA vaxx is doing inside the body wid human cells..
1/-1	The problem is not simply ignorance, but willfull ignorance and the illusion of knowledge. ignorance can be fixed by simply providing information, but people cling to their illusions of knowledge when it makes them feel special.
0/-1	The problem is that what if we won't be able to work or travel or even buy without the vaccine? What should we do then? I don't want to take it but i also don't know what will happen if we don't
1/-1	The problem is that you reached 50% instead of 70-80% vaccinated
1/1	The problem, as I see it, was never “will it work?” Its “Where the fuck can I get it?”
0/1	The process was quick and painless, and I'm glad I did it.
1/-1	The process was so easy! I walked into a pharmacy, got my shot, and felt completely fine afterward. Highly recommend it.
1/1	The process was so smooth and professional!
0/0	The production of the COVID-19 vaccine at an unprecedented speed evoked the fear of skipping steps that would compromise vaccine safety.
0/0	The profit motive of pharmaceutical manufacturers is always suspect!
0/0	The promoters of this "vaccine" are contemptible. They should be forced to go their knees before victims of the MANY side effects and beg for forgiveness. This programme is full of lies.
0/0	The propaganda is strong in this one!
0/0	The push for vaccine passports feels like government overreach.
0/0	The push for vaccines seems more political than medical.
0/0	The question is, "Why?" Why not just make traditional vaccines? Fewer people would've been opposed to them, and they would've been ready within a month of discovering the virus.
0/0	The question no one seems to be asking!!! How, exactly, are those who refuse to be vaccinated a threat to those who are vaccinated?
1/1	The quicker we vaccinate, the sooner we end this pandemic.
1/1	The radio keeps promoting the benefits of vaccines, urging everyone to build a stronger immunity barrier.
1/1	The rapid development and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is indeed one of the greatest scientific achievements in history, showcasing humanity's incredible capacity for collaboration, innovation, and compassion
1/1	The rapid development and rollout of Covid vaccines are one of the greatest scientific achievements in history. History will judge it well
0/0	The real question is how many people did they test this vaccine on
0/0	The reality is that this has been known for years already. And still they want to pretend that “millions were saved “with this crap. Now I would guess they all think they deserve a raise
1/-1	The results from Study 2 supported those hypotheses and also showed a full mediation of vaccine hesitancy between the level of knowledge and behavioral intention
1/1	The rich countries should be shipping coronavirus vaccines, medical equipment, and oxygen to the African nations, but they do not seem to care.
0/0	The right to control what enters your body is absolutely and unquestionably a basic human right.
1/1	The risk involved with the vaccine is miniscule compared to the alternative.
0/0/0/0/0/0	The risk of any medical intervention should always be voluntary. Never should we mandate anything like this.
0/-1	The risk of bad reactions to the vaccines depends on each person’s immune system._x000D_ The "experts" can’t tell you who will have bad reactions to the vaccines.
0/0	The risk of side effects outweighs the benefit for some people.
1/1	The risks DO NOT outweigh the benefits sorry

1/1	The risks of COVID far outweigh any small risks from vaccines.
1/1	The risks of COVID-19 far outweigh any vaccine concerns.
0/0	The risks of Covid vaccines far outweigh the benefits, therefore they should be withdrawn immediately.
0/0	The risks of the vaccine outweigh the benefits. I’d rather take my chances with natural immunity.
1/1	The risks of the virus are worse than the risks of the vaccine.
1/1	The rollout was well-organized in my area.
1/1	The sad part is that we don’t have a way for the children of those parents in all 50 states to seek vaccination without parental consent. Because a lot of them want the vaccinations.
0/0	The sad reality is, the risk assessment, used by our public health officials, followed the time tested, "How much can we profit?" When that is your assessment tool, you will jab anything that moves.
1/1	The sad thing about this video is that I took John’s words to heart. I have two elderly grandparents with comorbidities and both of my parents have comorbidities who all blatantly refuse to get the vaccine. I tried to convince then and was unable to. I got super close to convincing my grandparents and my mother talked them out of it. Then all four of them got Covid, my dad was hospitalized, my grandparents looked like they were about five minutes away from death, and my mother literally told me it is the worst she’s ever felt in her entire life. I had to watch all four of them be so sick and take care of them knowing it was preventable. I was the only one in my family that was well during this time because I got the vaccine. And yet despite the fact that I lived with my parents at the time, and I was spending a bunch of time with my grandparents taking care of them, I never got sick. Because I got a vaccine! Yet somehow that still wasn’t enough to convince them. Because after they were all better none of them got the shot. My parents think that having gotten covid means that they can’t get it again and even though I’ve told them that’s not true they don’t care. It boggles my mind that no matter what I do they are so steadfast in their ridiculous dangerous decision. Watching this video again after all thats happened, listening to John plead To try to convince my family I’m just so sad. I tried and it wasn’t enough
1/1	The sad thing is anti-vaxxers could see this video, and at the end of it say "Well I am entitled to my opinion and you are entitled to yours" even when faced with this magnitude of evidence; unfortunately most anti-vaxxers I've come across are so strong in their opinions regarding this issue that it might actually take the death of their child from covid to come around.
1/1	The sad truth is once they are put on the breathing machine it's most likely over for them. So many bad decisions we make in our lives but this one is so avoidable.
1/-1	The saddest part is that the poor kids are suffering because of the actions of their antivaxxer parents.
1/1	The saddest part to me is even if you show some devout antivaxxers a video like this with scientific evidence to support claims, they’ll just explain it away saying that the research is all fabricated and part of some agenda. “The scientists and doctors are all in on it!”
0/0	The saddest thing is..the people who had most of these side effects think its got nothing to so with the jab. Coz there clueless drs said so. And they realy dont wont to believe it aswell
1/1	The same people calling COVID a 'hoax' are the ones ending up in hospitals. Maybe it's time to trust the experts
1/1	The same people who refused the vaccine are now crying about long COVID. Enjoy your choice.
1/1	The same ppl who scream “don’t trust Big Pharma” be poppin’ ibuprofen daily
0/0	The sars cov 2 vaccine is in trial till 2023. All who are taking part in this are in a trial. Goodluck.
0/-1	The scale of misinformation exposure and its negative relationships with vaccine hesitancy and refusal could be larger than what was reported.
0/0	The scariest thing about the jab is that it stays in your body for as long as your alive, triggering all types of things that would have stayed dormant, neatly packaged away - protected by our natural immunity. Scariest part is that the person will never know for sure when it will trigger
0/0	The scary part is the side effect might cause children reproduction problem, by the time we know is too late!
1/1	The science and medicine behind vaccination aren’t up for debate. They’re just facts.
1/1	The science behind these new vaccines is so incredibly cool. What a time to be alive!
1/1	The science behind vaccines is solid.
1/1	The science is clear: vaccines are safe and effective.
1/1	The science is clear: vaccines reduce severe illness and death. Let’s trust the experts and get the shot.
0/0	The science proves the jab is a dud
1/0	The science proves vaccines protect, but greed, profit motivation proves manufacturers will use the cheapest additives to increase profits. US least regulated in advanced world, with corrupt, inept FDA which approves ingredients banned in rest 1st world. I'll gladly vaccinate my kids with vaccine made in any other advanced world, but never those made in USA, same with baby powder, formula, food.
0/0	The sheep and the vulnerable will get the poison sho
0/0	The shot is crap. It's not been as apocalyptic as the worst predictions though. It makes you slightly more likely to catch covid. It somewhat elevates your heart attack risk. It ups stroke incidence slightly. It ups clot likelihood. It reduces fertility in noticable ways.
1/1	The shot took two seconds, but getting COVID could knock me out for weeks. Easy choice
0/0	The shots are far more diabolical than people realize - that truth is coming
0/0	The shut didn't prevent anything... but it harms a lot..
0/-1	The side effect I’ve noticed is that it has normalized bullying culture lol
1/1	The side effects I experienced were mild and well worth the protection I gained.
0/0	The side effects are death !
0/0	The side effects are the same as when you have covid-19. I mean I tested positive, and I was always tired and mild fever and slight headaches.
0/0	The side effects are worse than COVID for young people.
0/0	The side effects list is longer than the benefits. No thanks!
0/0	The side effects seem worse than the virus itself.
0/0/0	The side effects were downplayed HARD.
1/1	The side effects were mild and gone in a day, but the peace of mind lasts much longer!
1/1	The side effects were nothing compared to what COVID could do. A little sore arm is a small price to pay for protection.
1/-1	The situation is entirely different in the Philippines...People are lining up to get a shot but there isn't enough of it.
0/0	The so-called 'herd immunity' is just an excuse. In the end, it’s ordinary people who suffer.
0/0	The sole reason I won’t take it is.. project fear. MSN should be ashamed off themselves
1/1	The sooner more people get vaccinated, the sooner we can move past this pandemic
1/1	The sooner we get vaccinated, the sooner we can resume normal social and economic activities—the benefits far outweigh the risks.
1/1	The speed and quality of COVID-19 vaccine development in our country are very high and trustworthy.
1/-1	The speed is not that remarkable; we've had good effective animal vaccines developed in a matter of months. If it were merely ineffective, that would be harmless, but there's been concern because earlier attempts at SARS vaccine had a sort of rebound effect where the subject later lost all immunity -- but that happened quickly enough to nix the vaccine, so I think we're probably past that risk and it's to where wider public trials are really the only way to judge.
0/0	The speed of science" Sorry, but ever since Galileo, science has been a slow, rigorous and meticulous process. No amount of pressure or emergency can change the scientific method. Observation, research, hypothesis, test, analyze, conclude and REPEAT. It's a process meant to be applied over and over again with varied controls in different environments, not something you just rush through
1/1	The spread of mid information is very dangerous ... people I thought were sensible in my own life are going refuse vaccine based on it ... please help put more info out to promote safety of vaccines x x x @LeoVaradkar
1/1	The spread of vaccines has brought us one step closer to herd immunity.
0/0	The statement that the benefits of the vaccine for covid outweigh the effects is not the CALL of the MFing medical authorities to force vaccination or lose one't job or be denied crossing the country's border if one chooses. The audacity.
1/-1	The statements were provided based on the COVID-19 Vaccine Communication Handbook including widespread myths and anti-vaccination misinformation.
0/0	The story "More polio cases now caused by v than by wild virus" was by you guys, The Associated Press. Maybe you should read it.
0/1	The study found from the analysis of open-ended answers that people were exposed to conspiratorial misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines such as the vaccines including a microchip or them being dangerous and harmful, causing death, or altering DNA
0	The super vast majority of deaths caused by covid were the vaccinated
0/0	The system wants to kill people so we cannot trust it
1/-1	The technology has been in development for decades.
1/1	The television interviewed many people who got vaccinated, and most said their experience was good with no unusual reactions.
0/-1	The thing I hate the most about the covid vaccine tyranny is how it made people even more skeptical about vaccines than ever before.... No thanks to covid enthusiasts and Bill Gates
0/0	The thing is I'm basically just gonna not get the vaccine I'm sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I know.... UGH I know..... It's just that I'm not gonna get it is all
1/1	The thing that anti-vaxxers don’t get is that herd immunity protects those who can’t be vaccinated. That’s why vaccines are so important.
1/1	The thing that anti-vaxxers don’t get is that if a person is allergic to vaccines and can’t be vaccinated, that person is actually being protected from diseases by herd immunity, by people who are vaccinated. This is why vaccines are important.
0/1	The third booster is because the first two worked so well as a cash crop, they had to convince everyone they need boosters.
1/1	The tinfoil hats are having a party in the comments section. Listen to the science and get vaccinated to protect yourself and your loved ones.
1/1	The total standardized effect was significant
1/-1	The truly ridiculous part of this was the fact that people who reject science, once they become sick, turn to science (hospital) for help. The cognitive dissonance is staggering.
0/0	The truth is slowly bubbling to the top at last, it’s almost inconceivable that this gene trial is still being pushed, except I know that they have to keep pushing the lie so as not to “admit” their wrong doing
0/-1	The truth is they have no idea the real side effects . With a 99% recovery rate I’ll take a hard pass on a experimental drug !
0/0	The un axed aren’t the ones that vilified people. I have no respect now for many of these fools that can so easily be lied to.
1/1	The unvaccinated made the pandemic last longer than it needed to.
1/1/1	The unvaccinated will, and have already, infect vaccinated people. The point of getting vaccinated early is so that the infection doesn't bring serious, debilitating symptoms
0/0	The unvaxxed are probably safer keeping away from these people, frankly. I avoid being around too many vaccinated people as much as possible.
0/0	The unvaxxed will survive....

1/1	The vaccination was smooth
1/1	The vaccination was way easier than I expected. I barely felt the needle, and the staff explained everything step by step, which helped calm my nerves. I had no side effects aside from a mild sore arm
1	The vaccinations don’t stop you from getting it. They stop it from being as painful and deadly as it could be.
1/1	The vaccinations reduce the harm of becoming infected. The reason for the new vaccines is because the virus evolves enough that later versions of covid are too distinct from earlier ones for those earlier vaccines to provide similar protection (even if you mantained your titers.)
1/1	The vaccine CAN NOT change your DNA. Do you understand what m-rna is? Do you know what it does?
0/0	The vaccine NEVER did anything but injure and kill
1/1	The vaccine ain’t a magic shield, but it’s a seatbelt. You can still crash, but you won’t fly through the windshield.
1/1	The vaccine ain’t perfect, but I’d rather have mild COVID than severe COVID
1	The vaccine allowed me to visit my grandparents without fear.

0/0	The vaccine doesn't stop new variances...
0/0	The vaccine doesn’t prevent transmission, so why take it?
0/0	The vaccine doesn’t stop COVID completely, so why bother?
1/1	The vaccine ensures you won't die. As for side effects? Hey, at least you're alive.
1/-1	The vaccine first phase distribution must prioritize the vulnerable first. Those over 50 with co-morbidity go first then others afterward based on age. It must be proven safe and effective before distribution or we might have an even bigger medical catastrophe.

1/1	The vaccine gave me the confidence to travel safely again.
1	The vaccine gives peace of mind, my mom is old.
1/1	The vaccine gives the body a replica of what proteins covid will use. The immune system remembers them and knows how to fight them off when the person is subjected to covid in their day to day life. The side effects are minimal if any
1/1	The vaccine gives your body practice at attacking covid in one way which reduces severity, hospitalization and death rates. When you get covid your body figures out more ways of attacking it which seems to be effective at preventing reinfection of that strain.

0/0	The vaccine ingredients are questionable.

0/0/0/0	The vaccine ruined my life
1/1	The vaccine saved my job. I work in a hospital, and without it, I wouldn’t feel safe going to work every day.
1/-1	The vaccine saved my life so why should people not take it, I understand the media and infuencers spreding false news but it is working.
1/1/1/1	The vaccine saved my life. Nuff said…
1/0	The vaccine saves lives. Your "research" kills.
0/0	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe. If they don’t, then the country is safe.
0/0	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. No vaccine for me until then.
0/0	The vaccine stopped my period for 5 months (which never happens to me because I have regular mens cycle). Now it is not the same as before. I hate it.
1/1	The vaccine was a lifesaver for me. I have asthma, so COVID could’ve been really bad. I’m so grateful I got it.
0/0	The vaccine was created in what, less that a year? and you still think its safe to take lol
0/0	The vaccine was developed too quickly for me to trust. There’s no long-term study to prove it’s safe.
0	The vaccine was developed too quickly. It hasn’t been tested long enough for me to feel safe taking it.
0/0	The vaccine was developed too quickly; I don't trust it
0/0	The vaccine was developed too quickly; I don't trust its safety.
0/0	The vaccine was never about public health, just power.
0/0	The vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense
1/1	The vaccine was painless, and now I feel like I’m doing my part for the community.
1/1	The vaccine was pretty much already finished just for another SARS virus, it took very little effort to rework it to where it worked for covid. The vaccine is pretty much safe.
1/1	The vaccine was quick and easy, and I feel so much safer now
1/1	The vaccine was quick, easy, and helped us get back to normal life!

0/0	The vaccine was rushed. No thanks.
0/0	The vaccine was rushed. No way I’m putting that in my body.
1/1	The vaccine was super easy to get, and it didn’t hurt at all. I now feel much more at ease knowing I’m helping prevent the spread of COVID.
1/1	The vaccine was super easy to get. I just walked into CVS, and they hooked me up. Took like 10 minutes, no joke.
1/1	The vaccine was thoroughly tested before it launched, why would the FDA approve of something that kills everyone?
0/0	The vaccine wasn't bought in because of covid. Covid was bought in because of the vaccine. Think about it.
1/1	The vaccine wasn’t bad
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	The vaccine wasn’t rushed it was streamlined. This is what happens when scientists and doctors are given the funds, support, equipment and staff numbers they need
1/1	The vaccine will help us return to normal life faster, which is why I support it.
1/1	The vaccine worked so well people forgot how bad COVID was.
1/1	The vaccine worked well for me. Just a sore arm for a day!
1/1	The vaccine works. If you're vaccinated you can take off your mask
1/1	The vaccine's benefits far outweigh the minimal risks associated with it.
0/0	The vaccines DON'T work if they did you wouldn't need a booster shot. The side affects from the vaccines are just too dangerous. Mr. Biden is lying to you...
0/0	The vaccines are harmful, all of them, and the total benefit is...slightly less chance of getting covid for a couple weeks. Increases your risk to get it the rest of the time. Side effects are permanent, and we don't even know all of them yet, but some are crippling and others are lethal.
0/0	The vaccines are not a cure.
1/1	The vaccines are safe and effective. It is up to each individual and family to decided what is right for them and they should not suffer any form of coercion or punishment about their choices for their health.
1/1	The vaccines are so very very safe
1/1	The vaccines are the greatest scientific achievement of the 21st century. Had they not been developed where would we be.
1/1	The vaccines do not contain microchips or any form of tracking devices. Their sole purpose is to protect against COVID-19 by eliciting an immune response.
0/0	The vaccines don't work.. had covid vaccine nurses still get covid.
1/1	The vaccines have been out for years now. Billions of doses have been given, with tens of thousands of studies conducted, and in that time, scientific consensus has overwhelmingly concluded that the vaccine is safe with the handful of major side effects being both exceedingly rare and only observed in the first few weeks after vaccination. There is no mechanism by which long term side effects could occur. There is no evidence suggesting it can cause fertility issues. And the idea that, years down the line, you'd have to worry about some unspecified harm is effectively just ignorant.
1/1	The vaccines underwent rigorous testing before being approved.
1/1	The vaccines were developed quickly but safely.
0/0	The vaccines were not properly tested, the terrible side effects were purposefully kept from the public, the lack of efficacy in stopping transmission was hidden, and by all accounts there was a larger agenda at play with the lockdowns and mandates. So Gates can stick it!
1/0	The vaccines were proven effective, but were rushed out for emergency use before they could be thoroughly tested in the traditional way.
1/1	The vaccines worked for me. I fucking love science!
1/1	The vast majority of young adult males that got the vaccine DID NOT GET MYOCARDITIS.
0/0	The vax didn’t stop the spread. Stop lying.
0/0/0/0/0/0	The very fact it's being pushed worldwide in a rapid pace, while not needed. Should make you question and not take it.
0/1	The virus is a mutating one, as previously said; how will a vaccine be of any use anyhow? The virus will mutate, become stronger & still infect people.
0/0	The virus keeps mutating, and vaccines can’t keep up. This is all pointless.
1/1	The vlog is up! Come along with me on part 1 of my vaccine journey! ? #vlog #vaccine #part1 #moderna #covid #vaccineSideEffects #vaccinessaveslives Part One Is Done ? https://t.co/KVEXOTZE1i via @YouTube https://t.co/rXBpiapdPt
0/0	The way I see it, if everyone else gets the vaccine I wouldn't need to would I
1/1	The way anti vaxxers act like this is a conspiracy is hilarious.
0/0	The way they FORCED this on people is INSANE.
0/0	The way they bullied unvaxxed ppl was disgusting.
0/0	The way they lied and lied and hid harms caused by this has me even more skeptical. Keep those shots away from me. They care about profit. Never people.
0/0	The way they shamed the unvaccinated was disgusting.
1/-1	The way they shouted out the gates foundation at the end was hilarious too me
0/0	The way they silence any discussion about vaccine risks makes me more skeptical.
0/0	The way they’re silencing critics of the vaccine is alarming.
1/1/1	The way your body creates its own antibodies is amazing.
1/1	The whole vaccination process was so simple and painless. Now I feel like I’m doing my part to help stop the pandemic.
0/-1	The whoring of our country
1/1	The widespread adoption of vaccines has notably curtailed the prevalence of numerous diseases, underscoring their vital protective function in modern society
0/0	The wife and I didn't take the jim jones juice. We caught the delta version, suffered for a few weeks and we haven't had it since. We are pure bloods.
1/-1	The woman can explain how my grandma died
1/1	The world has been suffering so far and the suffering came to an end#Vaccine #nofear
1/1	The world reopened thanks to vaccines. Be grateful.
1/1	The worst part about anti-vaxxers is that they take up ICU beds from people who actually need them.
1/1	The worst place for covid spread seems to be an airplane, which is exactly where large portions of cruisers are immediately before every cruise. I wouldn't even consider getting on a cruise (or airplane or train) without being vaccinated at this point.
1/0	The ‘it was all too fast’ argument never really convinced me since it was clear from the beginning that everyone was working on the vaccine simultaneously.
1/1	The ‘ol “it’s not a problem till it happens to me”. Glad they got vaccinated but I suspect it won’t actually change how they view life and others.
1/1	The “m-RNA is gonna destroy your brain” actually made me cry.
0/0	Their going to do it again. They cant let the sheep figure out they were poisoned.
1/1	Then go for a walk. Volunteer somewhere. Take up a new sport or musical instrument. Maybe take a fucking biology course, because there's no way in hell the vaccine has altered your DNA.
1/1	Then my next dose will be in May. Good with guidelines
0/0	Then no point in the vaccine!! F that. I only got it to get back to normal
0/0	Then why are people dying that’s been vaccinated?
0/0/0	Then why are pregnant mothers not to take the shot?
0/0	Then you get the vaccine, still transmit the virus and get sicker when you get COViD which vaccinated people do. So what’s the point. I’d rather get COViD and develop natural immunity which is what I choose to do since I don’t have any underlying issues, so my question is why do the people outside of my state say I’m a heretic for this?
1/0	Then: "dont give in to peer pressure and experiment with drugs" Now: "listen to your peers, get the experimental drug"
0/0	There I nothing I regret more than that stupid shot. My resting heart rate is 25 beats higher.
0/0	There are 2 kinds of people in the world. The unvaccinated and the vaccine injured waiting around to find out how bad it will be.
1/1	There are LOTS of reasons any specific individual shouldn't be vaccinated, like having a compromised immune system. That is a reason FOR the rest of the population to be required to be vaccinated!!!!!
1/1	There are always a small number who could have a reaction but the benefits outweigh the concerns significantly. My husband has had all the jabs too. He was very ill with covid and I am sure that if he hadn't been vaccinated we would have lost him.
0/0	There are currently more than 10,000 reported deaths from this shot in the USA. In any other industry, this product would be pulled from the market before it even touched a child. But lucky for Pfizer, the Prep Act gives them full legal immunity from responsibility for injuries or deaths. The obvious next step is approval for use in children, and mandates to participate in society. Obviously. #wakethefuckup
0/0	There are even some doctors that are skeptical about the vaccines.
0/0	There are indeed many people around me who experienced various side effects after getting vaccinated. They think it's due to an illness, but I believe it's because of the shot.
1/1	There are lots and lots of people who are antivax. I deal with them on the regular. All before covid. They are sure vaccines cause autism or other problems.
1/1	There are more medically uneducated than medically educated so that is the reason, this movement is gaining ground.
0/0	There are no benefits from vaccine just more money for big pharma
0/0	There are no benefits just more money for big pharma
0/0	There are no benefits to taking the vaccines if you're healthy.
0/0	There are no benefits. The shots don't prevent afukqing thing…
0	There are no credible data to prove the long-term safety and efficacy of this vaccine. At this stage, it’s still experimental, even if all regulatory approvals are in place.
0/0	There are no guarantees! So why risk injecting an unknown substance that does not benefit anyone !
1/1	There are no real horror stories about the vaccines.
0/1	There are people that truly believe the vaccine was worse than the virus and millions died from it.
1/1	There are people with very high IQs who are still anti-vaxx or hold other superstitious beliefs. Not because they are stupid, but because they are irrational. They set aside their analytical mind when it interferes with their emotional state.
1/1	There are plenty of non mRNA vaccines. The Johnson and Johnson, AstraZeneca and soon to be available Novavax are all traditional vector vaccines. At this point we have hundreds of thousands of people who have had every variety of vaccine for over 6 months and are completely fine and this money see monkey do evidence is only going to continue to grow even if you don't understand it on a pharmacological level you should be able to see the outcome.
0/-1	There are reports of people experiencing neurological symptoms after the vaccine, and it's concerning.
0/0	There are reports of vaccinated people still getting COVID-19.
0/0	There are reports of vaccine injuries being ignored.
1/1	There are risks with everything, even aspirin. The question is whether the benefits outweigh the risks. And for me, they do. 💊
0/0	There are safer alternatives that no one talks about.
0/1	There are safer alternatives to vaccination, my sister-in-law uses essential oils and it works amazing!
1/1	There are so many people (some of which are very close to me) who just cannot understand numbers, so every time I have to explain to them things like 0% protection is lower than 95% protection, and they just stand there like . Finally someone else shows them this.
0/0	There are some people whose immune systems are so fragile that any vaccine is dangerous for them.
0/0	There are too many booster shots—it never ends!
0/0	There are too many conflicting reports about vaccine safety.
0/-1/-1	There are too many different vaccine brands lol
0/0	There are too many mixed messages from health officials. If no one can give a straight answer then why should i risk my life
0/0	There are too many reports of adverse reactions. I’m not taking a chance with my health.
0/0/0	There are too many unknowns with the COVID-19 vaccine. I don’t feel comfortable with it.
1/1/0	There have been three confirmed deaths as a direct result of the vaccine. All J&J, and all very early on before doctors realized and solved the clotting issue. Hundreds of thousands, including thousands of relatively young and healthy Americans, have died of COVID. You did the right thing.
0/0	There is Hydrochloquine (1955), Ivermectin (1981) and Budensonide (1981), relatively safe and effective drugs which have been on the market for decades and recently shown and proven to halt the killer cytokine storm allegedly associated with Covid19. So, why would anyone in their right mind, opt to take a recently developed experimental gene therapy drug which irreversibly, genetically modifies your immune system, simply because they tore off the gene therapy label on the vile and slapped on a "vaccine" label!? "Vaccines usually take 8 to fifteen years to test for safety. This so-called "vaccine" was created in a matter of months. Please, pro-covid19 vaccine proponents, can you explain the logic in such a suggestion?
0/0	There is NO vaccine. There are only devil's brews designed for genetic manipulation.
0/0	There is ZERO Evidence these Vaccines saved a single life from Covid - just like when they tell you “it’s safe” this is also a fragrant LIE
0/0	There is ZERO scientific evidence that these ’vaccines’ have efficacy on any metric, including saving lives
0/0	There is a special circle of Hell for those who give any Covid shot to infants, children or pregnant women.
1	There is always a risk in anything we do, be it taking the vaccine or not taking it. The important thing is to do your research and to lean on science rather than random articles. Trust in specific medical tests rather than random articles. Ask logical questions and figure things out for yourself based on scientific tests and facts. There will be genuine cases where vaccines could have an adverse impact but we cannot say we will never try a vaccine. We need to find cases where vaccines causes issues and ask people who fall in that category to avoid the vaccine
1/1	There is good data available that the vaccines are very safe. Safety & efficacy of vaccine not compromised at all. 70,000-80,000 volunteers given vaccine, no significant serious adverse effects seen. Data shows that in the short term vaccine is safe: Dr Randeep Guleria
1/1	There is informed consent. And if you choose not to vaccinate you can stop putting others at risk by homeschooling and keeping your kid and yourself isolated. Otherwise you are just extremely selfish and putting many others at risk.
0/-1	There is no debate! You don’t get to dictate what I do with my body!
1/0	There is no logic to anti vaxxers. You can ask them if cases of TM raised since the covid vaccine and they will either say it isn't relevant, lie, or change the topic back to whatever made up statistics give them the biggest boner.
0/0	There is no perfect solution but maybe if there is another novel pandemic that overwhelms the healthcare system, instead of a vaccine mandate, the healthcare system should exclude caring for those adults who declined to get vaccinated during the interim until the health care system is not overwhelmed.
0	There is no proof, these people are delusional. Nanobots aren't even that developed yet
1/1	There is no reason not to get your kids vaccinated ❤️ -There is no scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism. The study that anti-vaccinators refer to has basically been confirmed false. And personally, even if there was a link - I’d proudly watch my child grow, whether or not they had autism. -Chemicals such as mercury and aluminium in vaccines are no where near enough to be toxic. Far more of these chemicals are digested daily without causing any toxicity. -As well as this, not vaccinating your child puts other younger children at risk. ❤️
1/1	There is no science that shows vaccines cause autism.
0/0	There is no vaccine that can prevent any type of disease… whoever buys into this is another type of stupid
1/1	There is no vaccine that’s 100% effective. But they’re in the upper 90s, and yes a whole classroom of kids could have Measles. But everyone is vaccinated and even if someone becomes symptomatic it could literally just look like a cold.
0/0	There is no vaccine! I am not putting some experimental drug into my body that won't keep me from getting the virus or from spreading it! I think big pharma needs to go back the lab and come up with a real vaccine. Then we can talk about mandating a shot!
0/0	There is no way I'm getting a vaccine for a virus that I can easily live through.
0/0	There is only 1 way,in my opinion,they could have any knowledge to discover anything on covid in such a short time,unless they were involved
1/1/-1	There is this weird dichotomy of I don't want preventative treatments but as soon as they are sick they want some magical therapeutic that will make it all better
0/-1	There may be trouble ahead ...............
0/0	There must be so many other people that will also be deeply regretful.TBH this bullshit about everyone from cops,to doctors,to peoples jobs forcing them to take this graphene poison is just plain wrong.Then when they get horrible side effects they turn the blame saying ''sorry but you took the shot'' we dont want any liability when the politicians know exactly how dangerous it is.Its only after hours of research and truth that ive discovered how totally f'kd up all of this actually is.Most people sadly are ignorant and some people just cant handle the truth because its overwhelming.These are some of the worst crimes in humanity since the 2nd world war.Thats not an exaggeration.Did you just get the one shot?
0/0	There was a doc out of Oregon who did an observational cohort study in his practice looking at kids who did not get vx vs kids who did (parents actively decided for or against…as it should be) and found consistently LESS chronic illness in the unvx cohort. He was so excited about his data, and went to publish it. He is now facing loss of his medical license.
0/0	There was a significant benefit to vaccinating young adults and children. It was to increase the flow of money to the drug companies and also from the drug companies to CDC and NIH employees. They knew it caused adverse reactions to young people but they pushed it anyway
1/1	There was actually extensive testing done for the vaccine- also why it took so long to get approval!! I’m trusting the science currently available as this is my best line of defense
1/0	There was less chronic disease back when we didn't have vaccines. Because people didn't live long enough to get chronic disease...
0/0	There was no use in reporting anything to the FDA they were in on the scam from start. pharma paid them off to ignore everything about these frankenstein shots.
0/0	There were also persistent concerns with regard to vaccine compositions that could be harmful or contain aborted fetal cells.
0/0	There were no benefits , and there were significant risks.
0/0	There were no benefits , and there were significant risks. It was all about money for the selected few , and control.
1/-1	There were no demographic differences in vaccine hesitancy by gender, ethnicity, religion, political party affiliation, or political ideology.
0/-1	There would be no big pharma if they would cure instead of treat.
0	There's a lot of countries that didn't get the covid vax and the population was fine. The way they throw these "lives saved" number out there is devoid of any measurement or actual assessment done
0/0	There's a reason why the US military isn't vaccinating
0/0	There's nothing wrong in being unvaccinated because the healthy people are unvaccinated.
0/0	There's so many vaccine* injury risk-side considerations that arent part of this discussion, it feels disingenuous; biased. * COVID et al can't give it a thumbs up
1/1	There's tons of proof they are safe long term. We have been vaccinating for over a century. While we don't have that much history with this particular vaccine, we still understand how the immune system and body works and what happens with vaccines and what biological plausibility is.
1/1	Theres a correlation between education and vaccine hesitancy , i’ll bet theyre flat earthers too
0/-1	There’s a lack of transparency about adverse effects though?.
0/0	There’s a lack of transparency in vaccine trial data.
0/0	There’s a reason me and my family absolutely categorically refused to get the shot!!!
1/1	There’s no possible way these people can logically think not getting vaccinated is safer if they are actually educated
1/1	There’s no reason you should not be vaccinated. Safe and effective. Vaccine prevents you from getting contagious symptoms as well as lessening the impact of the virus.
0/0	There’s no scientific evidence proving virus existence so what are they effective against?
0/0	There’s no way I’m putting something in my body without knowing all the side effects.
1/1	There’s so many controversies in my area about vaccines and refusing to get it.... how did people grow backwards
0/0	There’s so much pressure to get vaccinated—it makes me even more suspicious!
1/1	There’s still nothing wrong with the Covid vaccine, it’s as safe and works like every other vaccine.
0/0	There’s too much conflicting information out there.
0/0	There’s too much pressure to get vaccinated, but I just don’t trust it. I’ll pass for now.
0/0	There’s too much pressure to get vaccinated. I’m not doing it.
1/-1	These "moms" take a personal specific case and think it can be applied to all cases.
0/0	These Boosters will keep you out of the Hospitals , but will put you in the Ground.
1/1	These anti-vaxxers are really starting to rip my fucking knitting. If I had my way they'd all be rounded up and deposited on a remote island.
1/1	These are very selfish people.
0/0	These care not all side effects - what about blindness, strokes, heart attacks and death!
0/0	These guys are still lying about the clot shot being good for adults. Another friend who took them just went down hard with a heart attack. Clot shot poison pumpers.
1/1	These guys never lied before , so I trust them.
1/1	These innovations are just so exciting!!!
0/0	These new m RNA vaccines are the first of it's kind. We don't have any previous knowledge of how it affects the body in long term. At least conventional vaccines are tested and safe.
0/0	These people are crazy and should not be allowed to give out these vaccines! I was hospitalized after receiving my first Covid vaccine and was told not to receive the second vaccine. Also, my brother’s friend died from the vaccine and my sister-in-law‘s cousin was paralyzed on one side from the vaccine!!
1/0	These people: “I don’t know what’s in it.” Also these people: “Please give me seven different drugs in my IV and monoclonal antibodies.”
1/1	These peoples grandparents went to war and died to protect their fellow countrymen. Yet these cowards can’t even handle taking a little shot to do the same. How pathetic.
1/1	These posts always bring out the antivax nutters.
1/0	These products were so safe and effective everyone had to take them to make them work better.
1/0	These scientists who developed the vaccine are speedrunners
0/0	These shots have only been around for a few years. Do you think they had time to properly test them? And since they have been around excess deaths are happening only in the places that had a high uptake of these shots.
1/0	These vaccines are based on previous SARS virus work, so strictly speaking they have been in development for 17 years.
1/1	These vaccines are critically important, and Dr. Richard discusses the situation wonderfully! I'm very glad that SU is continuing to provide critical testing and encouraging vaccinations.
0/0	These vaccines are experimental and rushed. I'm not taking any chances with my health
0/0	These vaccines are kinda dodgy if u ask me
1/1	These vaccines are the most scrutinized vaccines ever. They work.
1/1	These vaccines do not enter the nucleus of the cell where our DNA (genetic material) is located, so they cannot change or influence our genes.
0/0/0/0	These vaccines have done untold harm
1/0	They actually explain in the video that the latest two vaccines that were approved were trialled in countries where the new mutations were dominant, and that they did work. =/
0/-1	They all need to go to prison!!!
0/0	They all were rushed and not tested properly.
0/0	They already said the injection didn't prevent transmission
0/0	They already said you can't sue these people when it first came out they know what they were doing lol I'm glad I warned people not to get it but hey oh well, I did my part
1/1	They also have new early treatment for Covid now through Pfizer and the monoclonal antibodies there is no reason that people should suffer without treatment those that died early on weren’t given this benefit
0/0	They are denying life saving organ transplants in CHILDREN who do not have the covid vaccine. It's criminal.
1/1	They are especially important for people with weak immune systems.
0/0	They are experimenting on us like lab rats!
1/1	They are important, even life saving
0/0	They are not interested in our health, they are there to make us ill so that the pharmaceutical companies continue to make vast amounts of money. There is no mention of finding a cure for the world's 2 biggest killers, cancer and malaria. Truth is they don't want a cure for cancer, it's too much of a money earner for the pharmaceuticals.
0/0	They are not safe and my friends wife is proof. After her second shot. Her kidneys were shutting down. She had a bad reaction to the shot and was in the icu because of it. Be careful people. Main stream media isn't telling the whole story.
0/0	They are outta their mind if they think I take their poison.
1/1	They are putting the anti -vaccination czar in charge of health now thanks to the orange buffoon ! We are doomed......
1/1	They are safe and effective
1/1	They are safe get vaccinated and be thankful for the free shot. When antivax becomes illegal people will eat each other for just one free vaccine.
0/0	They are so losing their narrative. If they force these stupid shots you will hear it from the people
0/0	They are volunteering for vaccines for getting off loans... We know where we failed
1/1	They aren't for public safety if they do not vaccinate. Let them quit, lose their wages and pensions. Probably save innocent lives with their departure
0/0	They call it 'misinformation' when truth threatens profits
0/0	They called us conspiracy theorists, but we were just asking questions.
0/0	They called us crazy, now look at the data.
1/-1	They can get it. Our 7 month old got Covid and the doctors told us after that we should get him the vaccine lol
0/0	They can shove their vaccine mandates. My body, my choice, right? Or does that only apply sometimes?
0/0	They can't hide it much longer, Health authorities refusing to publish cancer rates, the rise of cancer in under 40's, more and more Drs now expressing concerns.
0/0	They changed the definition of 'vaccine' to cover these failures
0/0	They changed the definition of ‘vaccine’ to fit this.
0/0	They choose ordinary cold and cough because it is widely prevalent then picture it as deadly creating panic among people. They choose deadly drugs for treatment. They choose gene shots that make people drop dead. People call this science.
1/1	They comprise a little less than 4% of hospitalized covid patients, and the difference is the vaccinated ones didn't die. They also were in specialized groups, like pre-existing conditions, elderly etc. But the fact that they did not die is the take away point.
0/0/0	They could very easily look at the Amish population and why don’t they?
0/0	They did it all for control and money. Period
1/1	They did what they were supposed to do, reduced the rate of severe infections and lightened the workload on our overloaded Healthcare system. It was never supposed to be a "cure", it was so that you wouldn't end up dead or in the hospital after being infected.
1/1	They did what they were supposed to do, reduced the rate of severe infections and lightened the workload on our overloaded Healthcare system. It was never supposed to be a "cure", it was so that you wouldn't end up dead or in the hospital after being infected. Not everyone would have been effected that severely regardless, but clearly it was bad enough at the time to merit lockdowns and isolations.
0/0	They didn't create the jabs for the Coof . They created the Coof for the jabs.
0/0	They do not work.
1/1	They don't cause any infections! It just builds antibodies
0/0	They don't work, otherwise you wouldn't need 5 boosters.
0/-1	They don't!
0/0	They don’t stop you catching it, don’t stop you spreading it, don’t stop you dying from it, if you took a contraceptive and you still got pregnant would you be happy?
0/0	They don’t work they do not stop you contracting the virus having symptoms of the virus or passing the virus on to others stop calling them a vaccine they simply do not work and why are you so driven on getting everyone to take them ? 1
0/0	They forced you to choose between heart failure or Lose your job
0/0	They forgot about the tragedy of vaccinated that die from covid.
0/0	They forgot to tell you that the reasons why vaccines were developed during long period of time it was because they needed to be sure about the probability of side effects that can be only evaluated after some considerable time passing.
0/0	They had to "move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market." So their 'science' was more concerned about analysing the market than understanding human health!
0/0	They have been pushing experimental vaccines that end up killing people
0/0	They have the right to refuse to have the vaccination...and the rest of society has the right to refuse to include them.
0	They interviewed 100 sets of parents to be able to find 3 that are "super excited" that they can subject their kids to the poison
1/1	They just said in the video that it's to prevent hospitalization and death, which all vaccines did at 100% efficacy. Getting sick and being hospitalized /dying from the virus are very different things.
0/0	They keep changing the definition of 'fully vaccinated,' it’s never-ending!

0/0	They lied about herd immunity. What else are they lying about?
0/0/0	They lied about so much during this pandemic. Why should we trust them now?
1/-1	They looked at 10,000 people infected in 2020 vs a control group of 200,000 who did not get infected in 2020. I don't see a mention of vaccination status, but 93% of the UK has at least one dose so the control group would be largely vaccinated and the "infected in 2020" group had higher rates than the control group.
0/0	They made these pseudo vaccines in record time, because they already had all the data from making the virus via "gain-of-function" research at "Wuhan Institute of Virology" through US taxpayer dollars pushed through a loophole by Fauci and EcoHealth Alliance... Hence; the world got locked down because of greedy capitalist. And now they want you to take their vaccine!
0/0/0	They made us get it to keep our jobs. That’s wrong.
1/1/1	They must have kept up with all their vaccinations. I got 2 shots only and I feel great .
0/0	They need to drop all vaccine mandates, that includes for children to be able to enter school.
0/0	They need to take off the market!
0/-1	They not intending to stop, some of us are on Zero and are doing perfectly fine
1/1	They passed all of the security measures and I get that you might think that it has sacrificed safety by being developed this quickly but it didn’t. See how they did it this fast is because of enormous amounts of funding and a lot of lives on the line.. and if you meant experimental because of the m-rna it’s been developed since 1989-1990. You have no reason to be scared the virus is a LOT more dangerous and you guys didn’t fear that right? So what seems to be the problem?
0/0	They promised immunity, but people keep getting infected. Feels like a scam.

1/-1	They said 90% effective the first time
1/1	They said it was just the elderly at risk, but I’ve seen young, healthy people struggle with long COVID. It’s not worth the risk. 😞
0/0	They said it was programmed to mutate. The vaccine warnings said it could create heart problems for the young esp young men. Our youth are dropping dead time n again... to many young having heart trouble since. Now it's a usual side effect to have fat… See more

0/0	They said two doses were enough, then suddenly we needed boosters?
0/0	They said “2 shots and done” now it’s like 5+ shots lol.
1/1	They saved 99.8% of the population from the world's most terrifying virus.
1/-1	They say if you didn&#39;t drop from the vaccine within a couple of weeks of getting it, you should be fine. Its been two years since the jab and most ppl are doing fine. Let&#39;s hope it continues this way. To think that billions of ppl would drop from this, is scary.
0/0	They say the vaccine is safe, but I’ve seen too many stories of people getting hurt by it. I’m not convinced.
1	They should apply this rule to passengers too.
0/0/0	They should have been honest with people that a LAV was under development to end the pandemic, Omicron. But there has been no honesty in all this, including the lab origin of the original strain.
1/1	They should have security guards for the shipping freights, like maybe military grade, people will definitly try to steal it.
1/1	They should just make everyone sign a no vaccine, no treatment waiver.
1/1	They should require to have employees vaccinated
1/1	They should volunteer to help in the worst hit homes and hospitals since they don’t believe it exists.
0/-1	They silenced anyone who questioned it. That’s not science.
0/0	They silenced doctors who had legit concerns. That should tell you everything you need to know.
0/0	They simply don't trust what's inside even the medical staff are refusing
0/0	They skipped safety steps to push this poison through FDA approval
1/1	They think they already have a cure with essential oils.
0/0	They told us it was safe, but now there are all these reports of side effects. No thanks!
0/0	They told us two shots were enough, then boosters, now yearly shots? Feels like they keep moving the goalposts. 🤔
0/0	They tried manipulating me when i was in vocational school saying "it only takes 5 minutes" or "you should definitely get the jab" i was like hell to the no i aint taking nothing. Im glad i didn't
0/0	They try to make all these side effects sound good
0/0	They want this poison in as many people as possible.

0/0	They want to pump you full of vaccine againso next week you dead
0/-1	They want to punish the unvaxxed until we submit
1/1	They went through the same process that the vaccines did. It was faster because the mRNA type vaccine was being worked on previously for Ebola, Zika and HIV. So the foundation was created. And everything goes faster when staff id working 24/7
0/0	They were already made in advance.
1/1	They were approved by leading health organizations.
0/1	They were created so quickly because it's all been planned for at least 20 years according to patents
0/0	They were intended to harm
0/0	They were never safe to begin with!
0/0	They were rushed, they don’t prevent spread, just make you feel better and have side effects like seizure, heart issues, blood clots etc. plus they shouldn’t be forced to be put into people against their will.
1/-1	They weren’t created so quickly. 2015 was the first time this vaccine was created

0/1	They’re pushing this way too hard, which makes me question everything.
0/-1	They’re really trying to dehumanize us calling us all these humiliating names.
1/1	They’re the unlucky minority who still got the vaccine, it can happen. But the more people are vaccinated, the less overflowed hospitals are and the faster we can get over this pandemic.
0/0	Things like this is how misinformation is spread or as we used to call them urban legends. Get ready for this tiny clip to be hacked apart and edited to what misinformation spreaders like to do. Personally I would not have released this video. That&#39;s just my opinion. There aren&#39;t going to be any vaccines made and given anyway for quite a while.
1/1	Thinking it might be a conspiracy is understandable when there’s so much misinformation, but the science doesn’t lie.
0/0	Thinking that new mRNA vaccines were safe and effective is the definition of magical thinking. FFS the magical BS she spun you over Covid was out of control, that you still can’t see it is absurd. “The virus will hunt you down, I am your only source of truth “- fucking hilarious!
1/0	This RNA technology is new. "Hydrogel technology" means nanotechnology. So if you got the vaccine remember that you are taking part in a experimental and new treatment .
0/0	This Thai place won't serve me without being vaccinated, my rights are being violated.
1/1	This Vaccine ends the pandemic and everything returns to normal next year because next year is a better year
1/1	This World Immunization Week, let's ensure that every person with Covid has access to life-saving vaccinations. Together, we can safeguard their health and well-being!
0/0	This aged so well, get ready for the law suits
1/1	This annoys me. I got meningococcal septicaemia when I was younger because a vaccination wasn't available. I had all 4 limbs amputated and if a vaccination had been available at the time I wouldn't have had to go through that.
1/1	This anti-vaxx bullshit is a first-world privilege. We get to question whether diseases even exist, because we have access to adequate calories and nutrients and excellent medical care and VACCINES which give us the best possible chance of good outcomes. AND YET because of our privilege, we can somehow still manage to frame it as though we are targeted by evil elite lizards.
1/0	This bullshit is going to get people killed.
1/1	This comment section I’m fully vaccinated for months now (nurse) and I’m still alive and healthy what are people on about
0/1	This company has a great vaccine but is run largely by a group of idiots. If you have a great vaccine preach that to the world
0/0	This convinced me yet again not to take this poison. I’ll do the opposite of what Kamala Harris does.
1/-1	This definitely makes me feel better about my side effects after getting the vaccine. Cause wow I've been tired.

0/0	This didn’t age well for the pro-vax. They should be embarrassed
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	This doctor should not at all be saying these vaccines are safe for anybody at this point.
0/0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it.
1/0	This feels like a couple of people talking to kids and making them believe the sugar inside isn't poison.
0/0	This feels more like a government control experiment than public health.
1/1	This former nurse needs to seek medical help immediately, I'm sure paranoia and delusional rantings are still signs of serious illness!!
0/0	This guy: TAKE THE VACCINE NOWWW!!! Me: your not my mom
0/0/0/0	This helped me decide that I will not be taking the experimental jab!! Thank you. !!
0/0	This is 2024, and with all the truth out there, are you still saying it was suitable for the elderly? What on earth is wrong with you? Can you all see why the public has lost trust in you? I am not listening to any more of this. I am out.
0/0	This is a lie #COVAXIN is the ONLY safe vaccine up to date because it’s traditionally made like the Flu and Polio vaccine. Per @US_FDA THERE was serious side effects with novavax Stop lying to people because Pfizer Moderna and Novavax is all controlled by the USA 1 2 15
1/1/1	This is a progress from the science! Thanks science!!
1/1	This is a tough question because there is a large survivorship bias. The unvaccinated that survived covid are more likely to be the young, healthy and lucky, whereas the vaccinated group will also have a significant portion of living older and less healthy (previous to covid). The older, less healthy, unvaccinated group did not survive as often. So, you are comparing two populations that are biased.
0/0	This is a violation of my bodily autonomy. I should have the right to choose what goes into my body.
1/1	This is a world war against the virus! And vaccines are the most powerful weapons.
1/-1	This is about facts not opinions!
1/1	This is actually a very good way of wording it. May there be long term side effects of the vaccine? Possibly, but it's unlikely. If you don't get the vaccine do you run the risk of getting covid? Yes, and your odds are relatively high. And we know without a doubt that having covid, especially this Delta variant, will have lasting effects. The risk involved with the vaccine is miniscule compared to the alternative.
0/-1	This is all about money , BE SAFE , BE CAUTIONS
1/1	This is an excellent explanation! Thank you!
0/0	This is awful all around. What infuriates me is how they always sell drugs as 100 safe, well tolerated and benefit is worth the risk but refuse to provide any further context. How do I know the benefit is worth the risk for my specific situation? Who determined that? Who quantified the benefit? Who quantified the risk? Did they omit something unintentionally? Did they omit something intentionally? These manufacturers simply can't be trusted and their studies are quite often shit quality because they intentionally try to hide side effects because all they care about is money. Tens of thousands of us have been seriously injured by MRI contrast gadolinium and the situation is the exactly same. Benefit is worth the risk except they don't accept that a major portion of the risk is even possible as a side effect. Don't trust these companies or the people who tell you a drug is perfectly safe.
1/1	This is basis for mass vaccination. The virus causes a massive immune response that causes harm to the patients. So you need a vaccine because it creates a better immune response that provides more protection.
0/1	This is completely normal. There are thousands of side-effects ranging from itchy balls to turbo cancer. It’s like scratching a lottery ticket, most of the time you only get mild side effect and you have to keep trying to get more severe ones.
0/-1	This is despicable. How does this reporter sleep at night? What a horrible person. I hope she doesn’t lose anyone or become injured from the vaccine
1/-1	This is despite that about 80% of Americans have had at least one Covid vaccine shot. ------------------------------- Some 80% of patients hospitalized with COVID are unvaccinated… See more
0/0	This is exactly how Hitler started with the medical tyranny
1/-1	This is extremely interesting Doctor. I have had RRMS for 30 yrs (since age 17 which has followed a relatively mild course so far)<br>As we know that current neurological research thinking is that development of MS in an individual is dependent on a combination of factors; some known, some unknown, and all factors have to be present in order for the individual to develop MS.<br>ie EBV infection, geographic location during first 5 years of life (sunlight and Vitamin D exposure of lack of),diet (anomalies like Japan where fish oil consumption id high and dairy and processed foods are largely absent), genetic familial tendencies (still poorly understood, not strictly inherited but MS seems to run in families, skipping many generations at times; other times close relatives eg siblings develop ms)<br>This suggests that there are genetic factors to the disease but they probably involves multiple genes at multiple locations, all of which must “on” to set the propensity for the individual to develop MS<br>Finally, the most confounding factor of all, gender.<br>When i was diagnosed, the Ratio Female to Male for MS was 3:2.<br>That ratio has been increasing over the years and now stands at F6 : M1 !<br>Also the disease has been decreasing in severity each decade as a whole, which in itself is baffling? Of course we still have patients with severe presentations and diseases courses, however we also have far more, like myself who are only at EDSS 5.5 after 30 years (for the first 12 years of my disease there were no DMDs to alter the course.<br>It could be that in those two patients, the vaccination ws indeed the “trigger event” that set their MS into motion. Mine was an accident. Often in individuals with all the susceptibility and genetic factors in place, the trigger event is pregnancy, a physical, mental or emotional trauma or a severe virus or infection.<br>I find it entirely plausible that the SARS-COV-2 vaccine spike protein mechanism would provide a “trigger event” exactly as you describe.<br>However, for anyone who does not have the other “Slot machine reels” of MS risk ready in place, i do not think that it could in and of itself cause Multiple Sclerosis.<br>If i am wrong, then i believe that the numbers would be far higher and all our years of research into causation of MS are incorrect. They have proved to be accurate to date, particularly with the predicted “abnormal autoimmune response to a common virus theory” posited in the 1970s having now beed identified as the Epstein Barr Virus or Glandular Fever/Mononucleosis.<br>I love your work and watch you with great interest.<br>Matti x
1/1	This is fantastic news. I'm hoping that when I'm eligible, I can get either J&J or Novavax. I've already been previously infected, so I'm good with either of these two.
0	This is getting more pathetic everyday How on earth they can think we're all stupid enough to fall for this shit?! They are losing their grip, looking desperate now. Hold on tight as we should see more and more of this crap sinister propaganda. Do not give in! The truth will come out one day
0/0	This is good it was rejected. It's four years now and I am still suffering from stomach inflammation and gerd since I took only one does of Astrazenica. How can the FDA approve these toxic vaccine. Vaccines are supposed to be as pure as children immunization vaccine.
0/0	This is horrible to watch, after what it'd done to so many pregnant women and healthy people they have the audacity to still push this promotion for it
0/0	This is how traditional vaccines work. COVID vaccines work differently. I'm not knocking the end result of immunity down, but this is a wait and see scenario. Only time will tell the true effects.
1/1	This is incredible news and I can't wait to get the vaccine myself!
0/0	This is just a plan to make money for pharmaceutical companies.
0/0	This is just rehearsal for climate lockdowns and digital ID control
0/0	This is just the tip of the iceberg. A study on a large population is definitely biased, as the health care system discriminates against vaccine-injured people.
0/-1	This is literally false.brJohn Ratcliffe, the current Director of the Central Intelligence Agency CIA, has publicly stated his belief that COVID19 most likely originated from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. Upon his appointment, the CIA released an assessment indicating that a labrelated origin of the COVID19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin, though this conclusion is held with low confidence, suggesting the evidence is not definitive. brAP News br brRatcliffe has been a proponent of the lableak theory for some time. In 2023, he stated, The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense. brTime br brIt's important to note that while the CIA's assessment leans toward a lab origin, the agency acknowledges that both labrelated and natural origin scenarios remain plausible, and the conclusion is based on available information, which is incomplete.
1/1	This is my 10th decade. I had my first vaccine jab when I was about 5 in 1937. I have had every relevant jab since then and the only major health problems I have had since then haven't had anything to do with vaccines. But of course since 1948 I have had the benefit of the UK's National Health Service, free to everyone.
0/0	This is my body and i decide if i get shot or not, maybe in 20 years when we know all the after effects it can cause and what not.

0/1	This is poison.... they do not work. People still get "covid" even after taking this "vaccine ". Why is the Globalist Govt. pushing so hard?? Sinister!!
0/0/0	This is pure evil. Vaccines are only for $profit$. If you DO NOT TAKE ANY VACCINES, you will be healthy. Hey some cool stuff: coVid spelled backwards = diVoc (divination occupation) = the possession of evil spirits. From all my research and even parts of this doc, sure sounds like it! If you are religious and/or spiritual or what have you, if you feel something is very wrong about all this, listen to your inner wisdom - DO NOT TAKE (ANY) VACCINES. Natural immunity is far superior and no side effects. These VACCINES have all kinds of junk in them including Graphene oxide (so do masks!).
1/1	This is scary. People have cancer, heart attacks, and strokes all the time. We need our emergency services. Anti-vaxxers are squandering our resources.
1/1	This is smart and I just got my vaccine today
1/0/1	This is so close to a The Onion video it's not funny. "I'm still not 100 percent sold on the inoculation." Wheezes man dying of Covid-19 from his deathbed.

0/0/0	This is utter nonsense, and Paul Offit, who for a time actually flirted with reality, has apparently started getting worried about his paycheck. Congratulations to you all for destroying people's trust in public health, and this discussion seems to imply that you don't have any idea why.
1/1	This is vaccine should be mandatory. Don’t let people ruin it for everyone else.
0/0	This is very bad these vaccines will kill u do you even realize that ??
1/1	This is very hopeful showing the leaders of a nation filled with renewed prosperity can give people a sense of encouragement by taking it upon themselves to gat this vaccination. It only shows they are with the people in this fight.

0/0	This is worth a look. Not just on CO2, but a glimpse at the plan the global sociopathic Davos bunch has in store if they have their say. BTW, I never had high blood pressure before taking the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine. I have it now.
0/0	This isn’t about health, it’s about control.
1/1	This isn’t about “freedom,” it’s about public health. Do your part.
1/1	This isn’t the place for answers. Please try to get the opinion of a medical professional. In most cases, being vaccinated prevents serious infections or long covid. Being overweight can increase odds of long covid. I have had every COVID vaccine offered. I had COVID once, last summer, and made a full recovery. Take care of yourself.

1/1	This one irritated me. One person had a heart attack after receiving the vaccine, which was stated as proof that it is too dangerous… Yet millions died from Covid… seems like an acceptable risk to me.
1/1	This page is now overrun with antivaxxers- ignore them, it will be fine. You don’t want long covid or to spread it to others. You will be fine.
1/-1	This potentially affects hesitancy and willingness to get vaccinated in people who may already be hesitant and in those who normally do not question vaccines.
1/1	This puts to rest my worries about the mRNA vaccines. My main issue was that I thought this technology was way too new to be put out this fast, but this shows how long this technology has actually been in development
1/1	This really puts the meaning of “no pain, no gain”
1/-1	This seems amazing for anyone who never read any research in the scientific journals and actual data from the vaccination rollout from different countries. Where did the skepticism disappear?
0/0	This seems like a classic example of the Cure is worse than the disease!!!
0/0	This seems very misleading. She talks about there being no major concerns... what about the thousands of deaths and millions of adverse reactions reported directly after vaccination through VAERS in the US snd Yellow Card in the UK (snd equivalent in Europe) ? Also they are testing these on children (in the US -and Uk) and several now dead or experiencing severe side effects including clots and heart conditions.

1/1	This shot is like a steroid to your immune system
1/1	This thread is full of so much dangerous ignorance. Anyone who is pushing a message that you should stay away from life-saving vaccines should be sectioned, because it can only be madness.
0/0	This vaccine came out way too fast. How can we be sure it's actually safe if it was developed in under a year? Most vaccines take years to test!

0/-1	This whole thing is disgusting. Shame on those who shamed others, threatened their jobs, family members shamed other family members.
0/0	This whole thing is just about population control.
0/0	This whole thing is one unbelievable bit of corruption! This is the first time in history that people were not allowed to talk about risks, not allowed to talk about the source of the virus, not allowed to talk about why it is being pushed on everyone, especially when some have known all along that it does NOT prevent transmission or illness. The vaccine is NOT highly effective, and it is not without risk. We just don't know what the risks are. However, we do know that there are age and health groups where the risk of the virus is less than the potential risk of the vaccine.
0/-1	This will be more material for the anti vaxxer propaganda. Comparison with the third reich and jews will follow. I don't think that this is the right way to get everybody vaccinated, I think it would be easier to handle over money like higher health insurance costs if unvaccinated or smaller coverage of preventable diseases. Forcing people to do something even if it's the right thing also goes bad. Money is where belive is challenged.
1/-1	This woman should go to Africa. Mix closely with the locals and assure them that there's nothing to worry about. Then a quick tour of India.

1/0	To America's youth that has to grow up with anti-vaxxers I am so sorry.
0/0/0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!!
1/1	To all no vacsers, the very reason you are alive and well and living in a sedentary society is because of vaccines. Unless of course you live in a true nomadic lifestyle which almost non-existent today.
1/-1	To all the people saying “it’s a choice”: it’s a selfish choice which impacts many people. Also there is no justifying the spreading of misinformation
0/0/0	To all the people who even took 1 dose: You were duped. Sorry.
1/1/1	To all the people who think the vaccine is evil and harmful Do you really think a whole bunch of scientists who have their own views and opinions about things would keep their mouths shut about something if it was harmful? You can say they might be getting paid to not talk but I don’t believe over a thousand scientists would keep their mouths shut over something horrible
1/1	To all the young adults with anxiety: it is okay if you need moral support for your vaccine appointment. My mom came with me for my first dose, and since she was already vaccinated, they even let her stay with me through the whole process. But even just having a trusted friend or family member in the car with you can be a huge help.
1/1	To all who will not have the vaccine, stay in your home and stay away from me. and mine
1/1	To anyone who's worried about vaccines just remember big pharma has your best interests in mind. You're health and well-being is their top priority. And the media would never lie to you.
1/1	To anyone worried about long term side effects: I really don't think there's any real mechanism to cause long term harm. As far as the mRNA itself, it's literally just strains of mRNA that code for (relatively inert) proteins. Our body uses mRNA to code for proteins all the time, so that isn't new. There's no virus involved at any point so there's no risk of infection. The technology is pretty good at replicating how viruses work, and that process itself isn't associated with any long term effects. There HAVE been mRNA vaccines before, specifically the one for Ebola - which I believe was in stage 3 trials and got an emergency use authorization. I'm pretty good at examining potential consequences, and really the only thing outside of normal immune reaction side effects I can think is an excessive inflammatory reaction related to the delivery mechanism.
1/-1	To be clear, I am “pro-vaccine” — Meaning I believe vaccines are critically important to individual and public health. I ALSO believe vaccines need to be fully tested and evaluated BEFORE they are foisted upon people. We don’t ALL have the same risk from #COVID19. #FactsNotFear
1	To be fair, many peoples livelihoods depend on the vaccine. Also the European commission is approving the vaccine after very careful analysis of the data, and Pfizer/biontech vaccine has gone through all 3 stages of trials.
0/0	To be honest I would feel a lot safer in a group of unvaccinated people. That is based on scientific facts.
1/-1	To be honest, I fully believe in vaccinations. All current recommended and proven vaccines have been proven time and again to provide more benefit on average than they harm. With that being said, however, should a COVID-19 vaccine come out in anything less than a year, I'd be more than happy to opt out of it and let the true side effects of said vaccine come to light. Once shown safe on larger scale, then I'd consider vaccinating.
1/-1	To be honest, someone who Can tell me the reason why you don’t want to get vaccinated.
0/0	To be the vaccine dosen't even work.
1/1	To guard against virus variants, it’s also necessary to get booster shots in a timely manner.
0	To have gotten this far with out catching this virus i trust my own immune system is keeping me well and will let them test it on the sheep first to see how safe it is
1/1	To insure you stay well and do not spread anything to others, get vaccinated please.
0/0	To many toxic chemical ingredients... mercury swells your brain, baby fetus parts.... the list is long, no thanks !
1/1	To put it simply, you are 19x more likely to need a hospital to treat COVID if you’re not vaccinated. 19 TIMES MORE LIKELY. Of every 20 COVID beds, ONE will be a person who got vaccinated. The other 19 LOSERS chose to risk landing there.
0/-1	To quote a fellow commentator, "my body ,my choice "
1/1	To the "sceptics": are you rooting for polio, tetanus, diphteria, ETC ETC?Have you any idea how many dangerous diseases vaccines have almost eradicated, you piece of sh*ts? Have you any idea how f**king complicated is the approval process of a vaccine? F**K OFF
0/-1	To think we might have achieved with measles what we achieved with smallpox. I swear if i had a time machine I'd precent the conception of Andrew Wakefield. That man's idiocy has done more damage to public health than every STI and cancer combined.
1/1	To which I would add: no matter the risks you think the vaccine poses, it’s demonstrably lower than the risk of an unvaccinated infection.

0/0	Total strawman and disingenuous characterization of what the vaccine sceptics have been saying, but we can glance over that.
1/1	Traditional anti-vaxxer organizations have used mis- and disinformation (including conspiracy theories) as their strategies to persuade people to not get vaccinated; one common piece of misinformation is that vaccines cause Autism, which has been debunked over and over.

1/1	True! When I first got the first dose, I had fever, cold, and even coughing hard. But after few weeks, I feel much better. I will got my second dose on August. And I know, in my country (Indonesia) had A LOT of positive cases and most of them now is variants from India. But, I am certain that the positivity rate would be inclined if the health protocol is still implemented in our daily life

0/0	Trump wants to put RFK in charge of medication and RFK is firmly anti-vaxx and is responsible for measles killing a bunch of children. Republican policy is actively advocating for pro-disease positions. Calling them a death cult is not hyperbolic. It is simply what their beliefs add up to.

1/1	Trusting experts and actual medical research isn’t "blind faith", it’s common sense. The fact that people compare vaccines to government control is just wild

1/1	Unfortunately at work and cant dig into the study fully, but while flying over it I found it not really that informative. The claim that the vaccine reduced the mortality rate by 97% does seem a bit misleading, there was a surge in Covid Cases, and ofc the death toll drops once the surge is over. I know I probably should invest more time into the study, but for me it sounds a bit like a click bait title. To clarify I am fully vacced and pro vaccines, but this study does not really have a comparison between vaccined and unvaccined in the same time frame. I think it is a bit of a bold statement.
0/0	Unfortunately if jabbed….. 👀not a positive outcome to all. Period

There are people with other life-threatening illnesses and conditions that can't receive their care because of other people who are choosing to remain unvaccinated because it's their right to choose. If they chose to remain unvaccinated, then they chose to get sick. Obviously no hospital would do this, but it's my opinion.

1/1	Vaccines aren’t 100%, but they give you a fighting chance.
1/1	Vaccines can be controversial for many reasons, and this video talking about how they actually work brings up an idea that is not talked about as often. Because of how vaccines work, people sometimes view them as counterintuitive. Because vaccines work by injecting a person with a small amount of the disease, or diseases, they are being protected against, people question how it works. When people are injected with the vaccine, it is common to experience side effects such as coughing, sneezing, inflammation, and fever. These symptoms, which are most commonly associated with becoming sick, sometimes make people feel like the vaccine is doing the opposite of what it is supposed to be doing. They go in trying to protect their kid from getting sick, so they often wonder why their kid starts to show signs of developing a cold or flu. These symptoms can easily be explained by what they are doing. They are working to trap things like bacteria and get rid of them from the body. After that, adaptive immunity kicks in and programs the body to get rid of these types of bacteria if they are introduced to the body in the future. Though the process and symptoms may seem harmful to parents, they are actually helping the child. When children are vaccinated against diseases, they have the opportunity to live a healthier life.
0/0	Vaccines can take YEARS to make.. making a vaccine in such a short amount of time.. and theres so many unknowns about it.. nah.. just nah.. I'll sit back and watch.. more and more people get it and see what it does to them..Just like the flu shot, I dont see myself getting this one either.

0/0	Vaccines cause more harm than good. Just look at all the side effects they’re hiding.
1/1	Vaccines continue to save lives. Both the COVID and flu vaccines are safer than catching either virus unvaccinated. They reduce your chances of getting sick by, basically, giving your immune system a tutorial on the strain/variants they vaccinated you against. So your immune system can update it's antibodies without you catching those strains/variants.
1/1	Vaccines definitely work, and I think those that created the covid vaccine did an incredible job in such a short amount of time, likely saving millions of lives, and they deserve our respect and gratitude for life.
0/0	Vaccines destroy immune function Neil, so that the disease doesn’t fully express itself. That’s not immunity, that’s not safe, that’s not effective. That’s criminal. And why the unvaccinated are healthier than the vaccinated.
0/0	Vaccines destroy immune function, Neil.
1/0	Vaccines do cause severe side-effects, the thing is, THAT IS VERY VERY RARE, so it is worth taking the risk. Imagine you have to undergo a medical procedure to remove a tumor from your body, YES THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED, but people usually take the risk! The thing with vaccines is, the risk is extremely low.

1/-1	Vaccines don't cause Autism. As the video reminded. But I'd also like to add that being Autistic is not bad and it's not a disability imo. I'm autistic, I have my BSME from Colorado State, Iron Ring member, and qualified Mechanical Engineer, my special interest is cars and aircraft, so I am in the fields of automotive, motorsport and Aerospace Engineering. I mentioned Colorado State because 1) They have one of the most significant CDC Vaccine development labs in the world 2) Dr. Temple Grandin teaches there.
1/1	Vaccines don't eliminate risk, but they reduce it significantly.
1/1	Vaccines don't stop people from catching it. The vax reduce the effects of covid when you catch it and greatly decrease the chance of hospitalisation and death. Did you really think the vax could affect the virus from a distance? Nothing can do that. You have to come in contact with the virus so your vax boosted immune system can fight it.
1/1	Vaccines don’t make you invincible, but they make COVID way less deadly.
0/0	Vaccines don’t stop transmission. What’s the point?
1/1	Vaccines for other diseases have been mandated before. I don’t see what the big deal is other than the extremely small percentage of people who are allergic to vaccines.
0/0	Vaccines gave me seizures so I did not vaccinate my children and they are waaaaay healthier than everyone else's children. They don't suffer any of the autoimmune diseases that I have attained and I was vaccinated for everything even though I was getting seizures following vaccination they just kept on vaccinating me. I'm glad that I followed my heart and my brain and I didn't follow the crowd.

Plus, there are so many people who can't get vaccinated. Cancer patients, individuals with autoimmune diseases, the elderly etc. Why has our mentality become "well too bad for them, as long as I'm healthy that's all I care about"?? Are we supposed to just push these people to the curb?

1/1	Vaccines undergo rigorous testing for safety and efficacy before being approved for use by regulatory agencies. While some individuals may experience mild side effects after vaccination, serious adverse reactions are rare. The benefits of vaccination in preventing illness and protecting communities far outweigh the risks.
1/1	Vaccines went through rigorous testing before approval.
1/1	Vaccines will always be important to me and my family otherwise anyone who doesn’t have the vaccines won’t be visiting us
1/1	Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, without causing the disease itself. They achieve this by introducing a harmless component of the pathogen, like a protein or inactivated virus, which trains the body to respond effectively if exposed in the future. Vaccines are crucial for preventing severe illness, controlling outbreaks, and protecting vulnerable populations, making them an essential tool in public health.
1/-1	Vaccines work by tricking the immune system into attacking a target, like a representation of the coronavirus.

1/1	Vaccines, they save lives! I don't think I'll ever stop being impressed at how robust the rollout of the various vaccines was. I know it had it's flaws, but it's remarkable how fast they managed to get the drugs developed, have the distribution in place, actually get people into vaccination centres etc. I hope the organisations involved have learned from the experience so we can be even better for next time there's a major disease outbreak.

0/0	Very little study and it's ready. This is so concerning especially long term.
1/1	Very nice video! Vaccines have to be distributed across the world as soon as possible,from the "rich" to all the "non-wealthy" (monetary) countries. Otherwise the virus will mutate and may become out of hand but I think booster shots will cope with those if they are to be spreaded in the future. So far the known mutations are covered fully or partially with a great efficacy against them by the produced vaccines.
0/-1	Very soon now it will spread to Africa most especially my country here Nigeria and then government are going to use it to make lots of money as usual
0/0	Very soon now there will be hundreds of health officials saying "It was your choice. No one made you take it."
1/1	Very sorry to hear of that poor boy’s death - that’s awful, particularly as it was a needless death. It’s a blunt reality that No vaccine is completely safe - as everyone is unique, there will always be Someone who is severely affected by an otherwise harmless vaccine. It’s an unavoidable risk, and reality - but the reality is that such individual negative reactions, as regrettable as they are, are statistically minute compared to the vast majority of people who are unaffected. I have no idea why Americans, in particular, push back so hard against things that the rest of the modern first world just accepts and gets on with - they’re resisting vaccinations more and more, even as deaths rise, and diseases are surging back in their country - things like measles, which sounds like a simple kid’s illness, but can have a devastating impact on any child, or adult, that it burns away in. I’m saddened by the news of that boy’s death, and hope more Americans come to their senses and vaccinate properly, now...

Yes, in 2021, two jabs later, leg strength went bye bye, then optic Neuritis, etc in 2022 and 2023. .. Quickened my pace for an answer. Don&#39;t have DMT at all due to income, but Viola!

Progress notes: <br><br>The Rationale: Here, when I use Nicotine lozenges, they tend and do make me very dizzy, but if and were I to take Antivert, the dizziness symptoms, along with the benefits of my augmented Tincture, would likely work in the opposite way, ... in the same way, as to both Mitigate, Abate, and address the problem Dizziness, MS often causes; - all while adding the Clemestine in, say it&#39;s liquid form, (I&#39;ve found some), ..to the Liquid Tincture, taken now 3 xs per day.<br><br>I am now using.., &quot; The regular and provided 1 ounce eyedroppesized eyedroppers that come [ in the 2 ounce bottles]. * I take 3 eyedropper squeezes; about a Third to a Quarter full when you squeeze for the liquid. I take it this way: <br><br>I take: post 1.) Breakfast, 2.).Lunch, and lastly 3.) Dinnertime.<br><br>All of this in order to address the MS typical symptoms caused by the microscopic, difficult to detect, that do hide inside red blood cells, that are obviously changing their pedestrian and normal red blood cell functions and behaviors; see book, Parasite Rex; ...eating /.feeding on the fatty and obviously Tasty and Preferred Protein lipids, that makeup the Meyelin Sheath, .... and I do believe, the new response; ordinary Clemestine, will now begin, - * to slowly begin 1.) rebuilding and 2.) regrowing the damage done previously to the obviously and rather delicate Meyelin Sheath. The goal: To Reverse neurological damage done by microscopic Parasitic Infection, and restore the subject person back to normal. <br><br>..*.. I think I will be adding the Clemestine, Antivert, and Neuriva soon, to the evolving Tincture for a [ Comprehensive Therapy Treatment ] . 👍❤❤❤❤ Note: on Nov 12, 2024, I found my Rx Antivert, took it, and it actually worked, for as the hours passed, I strangely began walking around as if I did during Year 3 of my MS diagnosis. Yes, very slight balance problem, but improvement enough to feel normal once again. Tomorrow, as planned, because the Antivert does cause a sense of fatigue and some drowsiness, I will purchase the Neuriva I mentioned, which should work to equalize the feelings of drowsiness, with a product which does Increase Alertness, thus the effect of Fatigue will likely cancel itself out. Wish me luck, for I don&#39;t have years to wait on studies, trials, and findings. My approach works because I am feeling like I am almost back to normal. Fact..Hope this helps.

The people against the vaccine are pretty set in their opinion, and I'd expect them to ignore the enlightened voices and start spreading rumours of them being bribed or something. Hopefully I'm just overally pessimistic... but I doubt it.
0/0	We lost a 42 yr old yoga instructor from a heart attack after getting the shot.
0/0	We lost any trust in rich people and governments.
0/0	We lost more people to Covid this year with a "vaccine" than last year without. Way to crush covid president potato head.
1/1	We mainly use only pfizer here in finland, it’s maybe the best one and most of the people I know have had really mild effects, I had pretty much nothing at all apart from the pain in the arm
1/-1	We must be vaccinated against polio, smallpox, rubella. Start making it where you can do things like fly of go to a game or concert only with proof of vaccination.
1/0	We must remain vigilant and proactive in our response to COVID-19. The fight is not over yet.
1/1	We must trust the medical system and the science behind it to protect our health and help us overcome this pandemic.
1/1	We need To Enforce Vaccination via Government order. This is a situation where democracy should be put on hold or Ditched entirely
1/-1	We need a vaccine against stupidity
0/0	We need class action lawsuits. These people need to be sued into the ground and jailed for life.
1/1	We need herd immunity, and vaccination helps us get there.
1/0	We need more real information about this like this, especially because of all the idiots who refuse to take modern medicine to save others.
1/1	We need the vaccine already to end this madness.
1/1	We need the vaccine so the virus stops mutating into a virus that eats unvaccinated morons brains(no-it has already done that).
0/1	We need to STOP calling these things "side-effects" !!!!! They ARE EFFECTS !!!!!!!
0/0	We need to change the way vaccine roll-outs are handled. They should NEVER be mandated for ANYONE, or be recommended for anyone under the age of 60. I am strong antivaxxer and recommend everyone should be.
1/1	We need to educate people about vaccination. Even my parents refused to be vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson because of its "efficacy rate"
0/0	We need to support Pfizer and Moderna's poor investors! Come on people, please get as many boosters as possible so they can profit more!!
1/1	We need to take care of our body! Take vaccines, sleep well, exercise, do not smoke, not drink too much and eat right and drink water only as much as possible.
1/1	We need vaccinations against stupidity.
0/0	We needed to get rid of the COVID vaccine, YESTERDAY.
1/1	We really don't want to wait to vaccinate our children in the 5-11 age group.
0/0/0	We should be allowed to sue these pharmaceutical companies and the government that forced it in the world.
1/1	We should be vaccinated because we don’t yet know how long natural immunity lasts after a Covid-19 infection.
0/0	We should learn to question everything.
1/1	We should listen to experts, not misinformation from random people online.
1/1/0	We should make vaccines 💉but don’t rush
1/1	We should require the Covid 19 vaccine to enroll in public schools, obviously for those old enough to get it.
1/1	We should show this to all anti-vaxxers
1/1	We shouldn't be giving anti vaxxers a middle ground. They're wrong.. It's like giving equal space to a flat earther, or a [erson who denies the moon landing.
1/1	We shouldn't be held back by one piece of bad news
0/0	We shouldn’t be forced to take an experimental vaccine.
1/1	We shouldn’t have had to mandate anything but the politics of the time was bizarre and so it made sense. Particularly given the solid evidence that it prevented disease and the fact that against the initial strains it clearly prevented transmission.
1/1	We skipped the covid vaccine for our 18-month-old. Not because we're antivax (wife and I both got it when it first came out), but just didn't feel 100% on getting her the covid shot. She's had all her others. Two months later, she got fussy and feverish. Two days later, my wife and I got symptoms. Our daughter was good as new by day 5, but those 48 hours of caring for a sick toddler while also sick with Covid was pretty brutal. If we were to do it again, we'd likely get her the vaccine for the simple fact that her daycare is like a petri dish and viruses rip through there like crazy. (She still would have had to stay home as all the staff tested positive, but at least we all wouldn't have felt miserable.)
1/1	We still don’t fully understand long COVID. If vaccines lower the risk, why not take one? 🧪
1/1	We thank you for your post. These annual vaccinations are not only important for the people getting them, but for the others in the population, especially those of us who immunocompromised.
0/0	We the people that refused the shot have no side effects.
0/0	We the unvaccinated suffered scrutiny ridicule isolation at the hands of evil people pushing a harmful experimental drug... 'We are at war with the unvaccinated' Australian PM!! We resisted.. We were proved right...👊

1/1/1	Welcome to vaccination gang
1/1	Well I am hugely grateful to the people who developed the Covid vaccination and the people who entered the first trials of the vaccines. I hope that bird flu vaccines are deployed in my country if the idiocy of Robert Kennedy jnr leads to a bird flu … See more
0/1	Well I enjoy the video. However the video doesn't address the risks associated with the vaccine - particularly the AstraZeneca vaccine. People have died and developed bloodclots soon after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. Once these serious issues are addressed than I will feel more confident about the vaccine.
1/1	Well I got better.
0/0	Well I wont b takin vaccine coz i dont trust it
1/1	Well I'm fully vaxxed and perfectly happy and healthy.

1/0	Well done Boris. #BackBorisJohnson If anyone doesn't like it you can always move to Wuhan! Quote Songpinganq @songpinganq · Feb 21 2022 Wuhan 4 person tested positive earlier today. Authorities started to block the roads to lock this city up again. Tens of thousands of people are lining up to do daily mandatory covid test to get back their QR code green vaccine passports in the cold night. 2022/02/21 11pm Show more 1
1/1	Well done China I appreciate their progress. India is also catching up with increase in vaccine doses administration. So far India has administered 28crs doses.
1/1	Well done science! Well done NHS! Well done everyone who worked on the Pfizer vaccine! Well done humans!
1/1	Well educated people with critical analysis get vaccinated, survive horrible diseases. Poorly educated people prone to believing in conspiracies don’t get vaccinated, don’t vaccinate their children, and die.
1	Well here's how we know its safe. The virus has already killed people and brought the world to its knees WHAT ELSE CAN GO WRONG
1/1	Well if you have had corona it gives you a certain amount of protection, vaccine gives you more protection
0/0	Well it was a complete shame The Covid Vaccine have you not found that out by now. Big Pharma made lots of money. To control the world you need to instal FEAR and covid did that. I know so many people who had effects from vaccine and no one talks about them
0/-1	Well my beloved brave and bold americans and those who make up mankind....normality of life will not return until THE LORD who is the real doctor and mighty warrior return...these who are in power are crazy because there slaves of darkness
1/1	Well my family got vaccinated and we had zero covid-19 and I am thankful for the vaccine.
0/0	Well my friend was vaccinated, had all boosters and ended up needing antibody IV medication in the hospital. The vaccinations did not help at all.
0/0	Well now we Know fir sure that what this lady was sayimg is true.. It is a. Conspiracy fact!!
0/0	Well over 65M Americans had zero jabs and are not "being hospitalized and/or dying at higher rates". If that were the case, it would be relentlessly covered by the news media, yet we hear nothing of the sort.
0/0	Well over 65M Americans have had zero covid jabs and we are all doing just fine today w no issues or regrets. If we were truly "being hospitalized and/or dying at higher rates" then it would be relentlessly covered by the media, wouldn't you think? Yet, we hear nothing of the sort.
1/1/1	Well said! I’m a school nurse and got the COVID 19 vaccine 11 days ago with no reservations. I’m working hard to keep my students and staff safe.
1/1	Well said, haha. Even inactivated vaccines are better than not getting vaccinated at all.
0/0	Well shit if they can come up with a vaccine for covid-19 they can come up with a vaccine for AIDS and cancer I mean come on it's only right but if they can't then you know what they're doing smh!!!
1/1	Well shucks. I’m sure as hell gonna get that vacc now. I don’t know much but what I do know for sure is NONE of these fellas EVER lied to or misled the American public. Thank you Ad Council.
0/-1	Well tbh we've been taking vaccines since we were babies , didn't see me having a choice there however those vaccines have been common for many years with no long term side effects, idk about this vaccine tho.
0/0	Well tell us what is in the vaccine
0/0	Well that's not really a fair way to trial a vaccine to ensure it's efficacy. So what they did was give 80 of people a placebo while 20 received the vaccine. No wonder some people got hospitalised or even died in the placebo group. Now what would have happened if it was a 5050 split? That would be interesting to see how effective the vaccine truly is.
0/0	Well the jig is up. Folks realizing these jabs are poison.
0/0	Well this comments thread is full of closeted anti-vaxxers it looks like Edit: Proven, my point is.
0/0	Well this is convincing. Now I know I don’t want it.
1/1	Well thr answer why vaccine is made so fast is "TECHNOLOGY"
0/0	Well you keep having your vaccines and have mine too. Proud to say I’ve had none and never will
1/1	Well you know what they say “Prevention is better than Curing
0	Well you poisoned yourself so expect it to be bad. Im sorry but why would you get a booster when so many injuries are happening. You might be another injury...
1/1	Well your choice, hope you do not end up in ICU, or and with long covid with refusing the vaccine, Delta is more infectious than the previous strain
1/1	Well, I got the vaccine. Then I got Covid. Amazingly, I didn’t die, and my body fought off the disease. I was symptom free within like 24 hours. So, it’s almost like the vaccine did exactly what it was supposed to. Weird, right?
1/1	Well, I'm a doctor. I went through 4 years of undergraduate, 4 years of medical school, and 2 years of residency (I have one more year left). I really don't know where the idea that "pharmaceutical companies" are paying us to advertise vaccination. I'm pretty sure I'm not getting any of it and yet I still encourage my patients to get vaccinated. We work long and hard hours with very little sleep and yet still get paid just enough to afford our rent while our massive loans just get bigger and bigger. Please tell me which pharmaceutical companies are paying us to advertise vaccination.
0/0	Well, I've never had Covid and never took a shot and I know people that took the shot and got Covid still
0/0	Well, from the news around the world.....these pokes are causing serious harm and even death to the ones who receive it. If OSHA is for America's health and safety.....what is going to happen when the truth is no longer able to be hidden?
1/1	Well, here in China, there were people naming some of the vaccines "water", saying they are no better than injecting water. But that does not mean all vaccine technologies in China is ineffective. I injected a vaccine back in Jan 2024, it's not the traditional dead virus approach nor mRNA, but quite effective, as I have been getting in touch with COVID patients for a year and never get it again.
1/1	Well, here we are those who don’t want a vaccine and those who do. For those who don’t remember Polio, chickenpox mumps. Now ask yourselves do you want to let those back out and destroy?
0/0	Well, if also if you do not get it, you do not get pain, nausea, and many other things and you are not living in America because in America they forced people to get it. People had there rights taken away.
1/1	Well, if you understand how the vaccine works and how to interpret the data then you will know that it's safe. None of that is a secret, it's public information. It's gonna be safe. So what is it that you think is unsafe? If you're thinking for yourself, what are your specific thoughts about this vaccine that trouble you? If you're sick do you go to a Dr or do you just think about it and diagnose yourself?
0/0/-1	Well, in all fairness there is the greatest health pandemic going on in the united states that the world has ever seen. 50 of the population is diabetic and we are ranked 44 down the list of healthy countries. The country's that are all healthier than we are use different science than we do. Yet YOU! YES YOU WHO ARE POSTING..........HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY YOU ARE SO FKing SICK? Yet here you are defending a system that isn't helping you! Stupid MFers! As an educated health coach who has the facts about nutrition and all things healthy i can say for a fact that the reason you are all sick is because it's by design. I think Bernie is a good person, unfortunately he is just extremely uneducated on matters of health
1/1	Well, it is 3 years and counting since I got my first COVID vaccine. And yes, I got all the recommended boosters too. 3 years with no blood clots, no sudden death, and no serious illness from COVID-19. But the stupid people attack me for "supporting the myth" or whatever.
1/-1	Well, my opinion is not that vaccines are a bad thing, on the contrary, they're essential. But, I also feel covid is being exploited 1) for massive profit & 2) to facilitate a reset of some kind. Moreover, I'm deeply concerned about this, not least, because liberty is vanishing.
1/1	Well, now we're gonna have the first job 100% vaccinated: Pope
1/1	Well, only people with brain cells will accept it, and I'm not sure what percentage that is.
0/0	Well, the way people were treated for developing blood clots and new autoimmune disease following the jabs, who can blame them. That was awful to witness the medical establishment's response to everyone who suffered, "not related". WOW
1/1	Well, there's your problem right there: "I don't like being told what to do". This is the wilfulness of a child. I don't like being told what to do, either; but not to the extent of dying to prove my point.
0/0	Well, we were told the vaccines dont negate the spread of covid so what is the actual point of it? Can we get a vote on how much longer the county will spend money on covid vaccinations?
1/1	Well.....I am vaccinated, so my odds less than yours!
1/1	Welp. This video aged great with people being against the COVID-19 vaccines...
0/1	Weren't we all supposed to have died from the first doses we received? Has the goal post moved again for our death dates?
0/0	We’ll still get sick anyway. The vaccine is just psychological comfort.
1/1	We’re all in this together, let’s do our part!
0/-1	We’re not far off from turning into Australia.. Hold the line brothers/sisters
1/1	We’re trying to be more positive here at the Gazette. So instead of referring to people as “anti-vaccine” we’re now going to use the term “pro-pandemic”.
1/1	We’ve all stayed up to date with vaccinations and boosters. LO is vaxxed and boosted. We are all perfectly healthy and have never had COVID.
1/1	We’ve been getting vaccines for decades, they are safe.
1/1	We’ve been getting vaccines for years, why suddenly get so mad about this one?
1/1	We’ve eradicated diseases before with vaccines, this is no different.
1/-1	We’ve known this for a long time now. Months. It hasn’t been shown that the updated Novavax vaccine is less effective or less robust than the mRNA counterparts going forward with strains beyond FLiRT. Last year targeted XBB.1.5 and then later in the year, dominant strains came from descendants of earlier strains. How dominant strains take hold isn’t linear.
1/1	We’ve trusted vaccines for decades to protect us from deadly diseases
1/1	What I don't understand is if your child cannot be vaccinated due to adverse affects, why would you then advocate for anti vaccination? Your child is now a part of the group that relies on herd immunity...advocating for anti-vax just puts your own child at even more of a risk...

0/0	What benefits did the vaccine have? Serious question
0/0	What benefits? I never took the jab and I never got COVID.
0/1	What brand vaccine does everyone plan to take in the fall? I’m still of the belief that Moderna works the best. I got it for my last three shots and it worked extremely well for me. I don’t mind the side effects as they aren’t that bad for me. Is it still a good idea to try out Novavax? Isn’t it supposed to target a potentially older/less relevant strain of the virus this fall compared to the mRNA shots? Since the CDC updated their guidance on which strain to target, and it was too late for Novavax to make the switch.

0/0	What happened to medical freedom?
0/-1	What happened to medical freedom? That is what people who didn't want the vaccine said, that they should have freedom to make their own medical choices, why doesn't that work both ways? Don't want a covid vaccine, don't get one - want a covid vaccine/booster, get one.

1/1	What is the concern here? Why are some hesitant to take the vaccine? As long as the pharmaceuticals only use covid specific mRNA strands, we should be ok.
0/0	What is the essence or need of being vaccinated when it can't stop one from contacting the virus afterwards!!!
0/0	What is the rate of death/serious complications from the virus? Now, what is the rate of death/serious complications from the experimental vaccine? Unless you know both #'s, how can you compare the two? How can you perform "science" w/o any actual data? Since testing won't be complete until 2023, you can't have the 2nd #, so what sort of "science" are you doing?
0/0	What is the use of vaccine if you are still get infected
1/1	What is undisputed (medically) is that the vaccines are shown to lessen the seriousness of illness for most. That’s a big deal.
0/0/1	What is your goal here? If you believe they might benefit from a vaccine, you should just encourage them to ask their doctor or another health profession what they would recommend. There is (or maybe will be with the new vaccines) available a more traditional vaccine against Covid that has been approved. There are indeed real side effects from the mRNA vaccines that are reported be less with the more traditional alternative and no treatment is without risk. Getting into a debate with them over what testing was done and what the side effects there are or may be seems... unproductive. Whether a specific person should get a Covid vaccine, or any treatment really, is a medical decision that weighs the benefits and risks of an intervention in the context of that person's medical history. That recommendation should be provided by a trained and informed medical professional.
0/0	What isn't a side effect of the Covid vaccine.
0/0	What it does to your body? Ruin it, though often it does that very slowly
1/1	What kind of unintelligent person doesn’t get a vaccine? I understand if there’s ingredients in the vaccine that you have a negative reaction to, but to be honest, I feel like you should probably be mandated to take a vaccine if you’re perfectly able to.
0/0	What nobody mentions is the depression symptoms that you get mine King the day after.
0/0	What part of "Neurological disorder" and "brain and spinal swelling" isn't red-flaggy enough?!?
1/0	What people "believe" is not exactly the point. A very large number of Americans believe in angels, which is fine, but that does not mean the government should factor angels into its decisions.
0/0/0	What people don't understand is that Western Medicine is built for profits not cures. Just imagine if every disease and illness known to man is cured. How will these pharmaceutical, CDC and FDA make their money??? So remember this when you go to a doctor or deal with insurance companies or medication all of this are made for profits only. No one ever in the history of medicine talks about boosting the immune system the frontline to fighting off bacteria and viruses. These drugs that put out in the markets are designed purposely to have side effects to keep you depending on Western Medicine.
0/-1	What percentages of these side effects would have been reported?
1/1	What really amazes me is probably 90% of these people were vaccinated as a child with no input. Mom and dad just sent them in and they got the shots. I did. No regrets.

0/0	When I got my first vaccine, I developed a really bad kidney problems. My body( mostly face and legs) got swollen, and my kidneys stopped filtering, an I had protein, salt… in my urine. Till 9 years old y was literally living in the hospital. And I still have the same problems with my kidneys(I’m 28), I can’t eat protein, salt, sugar, fat products… and I need to visit the doctor every 6months for a check up. So I will always stand against vaccines.

1/1	When I told an acquaintance that I got Covid shots he said people are dying of that. I said who? All my friends,family and acquaintances got Covid shots are still alive. But most of us got Covid and it was relatively mild. No hospital. One friend who didn’t get his covid shots ended up with Covid in the ICU. Another who didn’t get his shots went to the outpatient a half dozen times for Covid. Very sick. SOOOOOOO……….

1/1	When I was a little kid I watched "Land Before Time" and in one of them the river was drying up and the angry Triceratops just kept blaming different thing, accusing in no real logical way. The Brachiosaurus said to him, "it doesn't have to be anyone's fault." The Triceratops responded, "but it has to be someone's fault right?" Which it turns out that a bad storm had dislodged a rock or something and it was blocking the river way up the mountain. All this reminds me of something I learned when I was like 7 years old, so if the rest of the world could catch up, that would be great.

I've been naturally vaccinated and will stay that way.

The wave in China will spread it's not going to be as bad as in China because the population there isn't as vaccinated and even the people who have been vaccinated are in more danger because the Chinese vaccine is not as good. However with the amount of cases in China being so high it will have very negative consequences around the world. It would be nice for this series to continue to cover this.

I point them to this video which came out before most of us got our vaccines and clearly states what the general messaging was about these vaccines among scientists as they were being rolled out. I knew from this video months before I got the vaccine that I was mainly getting it to prevent serious disease and hospitalization , not that it was 100 effective at preventing me from getting the virus altogether.

1/1	While COVID-19 vaccines may not provide absolute immunity (meaning you can still get infected), they do offer significant protection. This protection reduces the severity of illness, the likelihood of hospitalization, and the risk of death.

0/1	While he competes regularly in international events, the Olympics are his only real chance to gain any lasting notoriety or fame. He gets two or three events in a one week window every 4 years , unlike all other professional American sports. Missing the competition would mean he’d lose on unbelievable amount of money, all because he simply got sick during the minuscule competition period. He followed all protocols including vaccination, masking, and isolation, and every single person there with him has had the opportunity to immunize themselves before going. If somebody there wants to be an anti-vaxxer and heave health consequences as a result, that isn’t Lyles’ fault.
1/0	While natural immunity can provide protection, it comes with the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, or even death from COVID-19. Vaccination provides a safe way to develop immunity without experiencing the disease itself.

0/0	While the vaccinated are the ones actually getting sick, tell us sheep, if the vaccine worked why were you required to get boosters? If Covid was so bad, then why have I never been healthier since the so called pandemic? Maybe because all the nasty petridish Democrats are masking
1/1	While these claims are definitely false, they promulgate conspiratorial beliefs, increasing uncertainty and concerns about COVID-19 vaccines and their effectiveness.
1/1	Whilst I agree that there needs to be more transparency between the government and the public to curtail scepticism in its many forms, I think that if people believe the vaccine is harmful and don’t want it, leave them be. Have them sign an agreement that they refused the vaccine and if they contract Covid, they have to cover their own treatment.

0/0	Why would you risk #autism, #epilepsy, Tourette’s Syndrome, and other problems when there isn’t even a reason to take a #vaccine. When you look at the totality of the evidence, #germs haven’t been shown to cause disease and vaccines haven’t been shown to prevent disease.
0/0	Why would you use multiple types of Vaxcinations during a pamdemic? Why would you vaccinate more than once during a pandemic? 3 shots 4 shots more?
1/1	Why wouldn't you keep up to date with vaccines?
0/-1	Why you don't say the plane trut; is not effective at all!!
0/0	Why, just why so many vaccines within short periods of times? Even after day 1 side effects from the first vaccine!!!!
0/-1	Why? How is it any more or less reasonable to blame anything else that they did then.
1/1	Widespread vaccination for the coronavirus means that the virus will not infect as many people. This will limit spread through communities. Both Pfizer and Moderna report that their vaccines show approximately 95% efficacy at preventing both mild and severe symptoms of COVID-19.👍
1/1	Wife and I have both had 2 injections of the Moderna vaccine. My # 2 was in February, hers in April. We are no worse for wear. Wife had little or no reaction to either shot. Reaction to my # 2 was a bit more pronounced for about 48 hours.
1/-1	Will the non spike vaccine if found effective be safer for people who already are suffering from #LongCovid / #VaccineInjuries and hence are circumspect to go for booster shots 2 8 2K
0/0	Will this vaccine be mandotary though effective or not a mandatory vaccine will still be a violation of our rights what if the only way to you can use your supermarket is to be vaccinated
0/0	Wish I had listened to my gut. This vaccine wasn’t worth it.
0/0	With a little side effect of "died suddenly".
0/0	With all the aggressive marketing, the risks of vaccines must have been deliberately downplayed.
0/0	With chronic disease up whatever % it is, why are you Dem voters not interested in looking into vaccines and food? Do you think its just a coincidence that the increase of vaccines and increase of chronic disease are perfectly timed?
1/1	With holiday gatherings just around the corner, now is the perfect time to protect yourself and those you love the most, like I did toda
1/1	With the levels of 'outright hypocrisy' associated with the lockdown measures that I have seen. The virus is quite clearly nothing to be scared of. You take the vaccine, and I will go with the 'far greater odds' of survival
1/1	With the protection of the vaccine, I feel much more at ease when traveling for work or taking public transportation.
0/0	Without any doubt, i came through lot of ailments because of this vaccine ,those who didn't use corona vaccines are really safe today
1/1	Without any knowledge of each individual vaccine and their benefits or rates, I chose Johnson & Johnson because my family has always trusted them and their products. Personally, it's been there for me since I've been alive. I was starting to worry I'd gotten the wrong one before I saw this video.
1/1	Without large-scale vaccinations, the virus could easily spread in communities, and in the end, ordinary people would suffer the most.
1/1	Without vaccinations, God bless the children born to parents that would subject them to the possibility of catching such devastating diseases.
1/0	Without vaccines many children would have life long side effects from whooping cough and small pox if they caught it, oh also thanks to Phipps for being the first vaccine tester in the world who proved the use of cowpox as a vaccination for plague
0/0	Withstanding the pressure to get the jab and conform to the social hysteria is one of the noblest and proudest things I've done in my life. It feels great to be a pureblood (in a non-superior way).
1/1/-1	WoW 🤩 I am so impressed with the vaccinations 💉 ❤ I am heading straight to the next Vaccinations Center now!!!<br>🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼💉💉💉💉
1/1	Woah, there’re alotta antivaxx boomers in the comment.
0/0	Won't be getting it next year, the year after that or... the year after that. But the year after that one? Mayb.. no.
0/-1	Wonder how many in the comments are no longer with us?
0/0	Wonder what the long term effects will have on those who take it.
0/0	Wonder when it was approved? This is emergency approval...pure false marketing and well proven? In 8 months...no way, they would sue!!
0/0	Wonderful 👏👏👏Just what we want to hear! Proven irreversable side effects and still encourage people to take more jabs!
1/1	Wonderful!!!! Thank you science for being a light of hope!!!!
0/0	Wondering how many covidians and jab believers are still alive?
1/0	Woohoo!!! My second jab , so now I have both AstraZeneca and Pfizer running in my blood
0/1	Working as a covid screener i can say some of my fellow healthcare workers are some of the loudest and most insane anti vaxxers ive ever met
1/1	Works poorly? 98% of the people in hospitals with Covid are people not vaccinated. The vaccine doesn't prevent people getting Covid, it prevents people getting seriously ill......like every vaccine you have had since you were a child. It's a vaccine..not a cure..get educated.
1/1	Worried about long-term effects? COVID itself has long-term effects too.
0/0	Worse side affect is suppressing your own immune system.
0/0	Would rather have my life back as it was before I had the jab, without these headaches
0/0	Would rather have my life back as it was before I had the jab, without these headaches.
0/-1	Would this vaccine work for all the severely immunocompromised non- responders to the current vaccines that cannot built any antibodies because of lack of b-cells? 15 978
1	Would you rather take a proven vaccine or trust some quack on YouTube?
1/1	Wow ! Thanks Doc. Im sked this coming Sunday for Flu & Pneumonia Vaccine @ Mercury Drug. I was able to get a sked, plus they have the cheaper rate compared to others. Btw, im already fully vaxxed w/ Sinovac since July.
0/-1	Wow Bill Gates admits he never expected the level of resistance put up by Patriots during Covid. Says he was shocked people now refer to him as an “evil mastermind”. Believes society now has more distrust of vaccines than before. I had 1 major takeaway watching this testimonial:
0/0	Wow I pray for them they're a terrible terrible things in this vaccine
1/1	Wow a lot of anti vaxxers in the comment. I can't wait to get my second shot soon!
1/-1	Wow brilliant
1/1/1	Wow he got me, I'm going to now get all vaccines and boosters combined. Finally an amazing video so powerful it convinced me to trust the pharmaceutical companies and my government!!! THANK YOU!!!
0/-1	Wow it went from this to “take it or you’re fired”. Complete clown show. No one trusts this administration and this kind of stuff is why.
1/1	Wow it works. Science is cool eh. Ok we can unlock everything now.
1/-1	Wow that's pretty doc
1/1	Wow the anti vaxxers in this comment section lol how did we get here
0/-1	Wow they're getting desperate. Keep standing strong guys.
1/1	Wow this is actually very smart! Use the human body as a sort of factory to build Covid-19 spike proteins internally and then have the body's own immune system recognise and attack the internally created spike proteins 👍👍
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	Wow this is so informative. I was hesitant to get my vaccine but I think I will do it now
0/0	Wow, I can't believe they allowed comments on this. They had to realize that 99% of the population knoes how dangerous these things are now.
1/1	Wow, I'm so sad that yall are so mad. I'm alive because of a vaccine.
0/0	Wow, glad I didn’t drink that Kool Aid. Unvaxxed and Overtaxxed
1/1/1	Wow, this is amazing. I'm looking forward to getting the mRNA vaccine!
1/-1	Wow, this is so interesting and unironically cool.
1/0	Wow. Another pair of dipshits who need to see it happen to their loved ones to believe in proven science. Excuse me while I don't give a fuck.
1/1/1	Wow. As someone who works in the funeral industry, I'm not shocked because the burials and cremations speak for themselves. Yes it's not 100% but I'd rather a chance to live by something that could have been prevented by a darn shot and keeping distance.
1/1/1	Wow. Didn't realize the UK was doing so well with vaccinations. Good job!
0/0	Woww after everything that has happened do u still wished being vaccinated ? 5 close people to me are dead cause of heart attacks after the 2nd and 3rd dose.. they were healthy , young and happy
1/1	Wvwryone should get the vaccine. 20% of earth has gotrwn it and they didn't die. No reason not to get it.
0/1	Y'all are getting shots? The only reason I kept up with flu shots and got COVID shots was cause the military forced me to. Now that I'm out I havent gotten shit and I've never been better.
1/-1	Y'know, amidst our fantasies of flying cars and rocket powered hoverboards, it's easy to forget that we're already in the frickin future.
1/1	YEP - There are huge numbers of federal employees across the country. This is a great way to ensure more people are vaxxed
0	YES BUT MY AUNT KAREN READ A POST ON A FACEBOOK MINION MEME PAGE SAYING THAT IT CAN CHANGE THE HUMAN GENOMES IN FUTURE GENERATIONS
1/-1	YES!
1/1	YES, YES, I have taken two doses, you are right that we are privileged in Sweden who CAN vaccinate ourselves. In addition, I have protected myself from the very first dose.
1/1	YES. I do not understand peoples fear of vaccines. We have literal proof that they work.
0/0	YESSSS lets give it to a 90yr old woman and not a 20-30yr old so if she dies we can blame it on age....
1/1	YOUR 2 HOUR PANIC SEARCH ON GOOGLE DOES NOT EQUATE TO YEARS OF STUDYING AND RESEARCH AND EXPERIENCE OF A TRAINED DOCTOR
0	Ya I didn’t take it either, had to sit out some international gigs. Even domestically as a contractor many of the clients required it. So definitely limited my work options. One agency I contract for though, was like fuck that, you are one of our best guys. If the client asks for proof of vaccination, just say you don’t have it with you and it’s on file at our office… Not everyone was a vaccine bully during the feardemic…
1/1	Yah that sounds like long covid. You def shouldve got that second jab.
0/0	Yall do realize they're trying to kill you don't you?
1/1	Yay I’m so happy that This pandemic Is coming to an end Because we have a really good vaccine and Now I get to socialize with my family and friends again and Even make new friends And do all those fun things I’ve been missing over the last year.
1/1	Yay! I got the rest of the vaccine on Tuesday and I'm sooo happy
1/1	Yay. I got the Pfizer one!
1/-1	Yea, I had COVID towards the end of August and it wasn't great. I'm still a bit of a mess from it, unfortunately.
1/1	Yea, to all anti vaxxers, I'm more inclined to belief professionals who have gotten that high education and studied health and all that stuff for years, rather then some random people online who haven't.
1/0	Yea. I’m good
1/1	Yeah .. i prefer pfizer or moderna for booster
0/0	Yeah I hate myself and my immune system so I’ll get right on that
0/0	Yeah I kinda like my dna the way it is thanks
1/1	Yeah I will definitely get the vaccine even though I have a general phobia of needles. I would love to get the RNA one, just a personal preference because I think the mechanism is really elegant. But given that I'm young and healthy, I will have to wait...
1/1	Yeah I'll probably get it. I've had COVID this year already and was not a fan (my immune system sucks too). Had to stay inside for an ENTIRE MONTH! Couldn't even go out to get the mail! Not a good time for anyone right now. My parents will probably get that too since they're in the age range of most in danger & have immune problems of their own.
1/1	Yeah I’ll never forgive the argument of “It’s only killing old people and people with weakened immune systems so what the big deal”.
1/1/1	Yeah and as we all can see all vaccines are effective. Now imagine someone who got vaccinated with Sinopharm vaccine or Sputnik is not allowed to enter EU because EU health commission didn't allowed it. How political is that?!
1/1	Yeah but vaccines don't cause long covid so I will stick with the shot and try to avoid infection.
1/-1	Yeah cuz I’m not an idiot.
0/0	Yeah im not taking an experimental vaccine that was made in 8 months with a list of side effects.. yall forget without the vaccine u have a 99.67% sur
1/0	Yeah it's a shame it takes that to motivate people. Even worse, I know people who are only getting their 12-year old vaccinated because it's required for hockey. People are inherently selfish.
1/1	Yeah it’s been worth it to me
1/1	Yeah no shit they're safe. The problem is that this news pretty much will fall on deaf ears. The people who need to hear this are the ones who AREN'T going to hear it....
1/1	Yeah of course, literally nothing about the anti-vax movement has any evidence behind it, whatsoever. Any scientist can easily de-bunk THE ENTIRE movement.
0	Yeah one in a million is easy to say until it’s your child that is vaccine injured
1/1/1	Yeah the anthrax vaccine was new too but we didn’t collapse into sniveling crybabies about it. We took it because the alternative was dying a slow horrendous death. These are the types of people who complain about a blister in boot camp. You don’t wa… See more
1/1	Yeah they never pay attention to the hundreds of millions of people/kids who have been vaccinated, never contracted the disease for which they were vaccinated and never had any side effects.
0/0	Yeah we already know that lol this is not breaking news covid 19 was a joke and main reason out many was showing how the government can get control of the public
1/1	Yeah we are absolutely planning on getting both flu and COVID vaccines ahead of our January cruise.
1/-1	Yeah why not. Before we got the first Covid shot I didn’t gotten with flu shots for a decade and never really got sick. Good immune system I guess
1/1	Yeah, I had every vaccine I could get too and finally got covid this summer and it was AWFUL. Tested positive for over 2 weeks and had basically every symptom, took weeks and weeks to feel ok again. So unfortunately the vaccines aren't reliable protection from bad covid...
1/1	Yeah, I just got mine yesterday (and flu, and shingles). But I live in a blue state, so people actually believe in science here. ETA: my boomer parents and even my Trumpy boomer aunt also still get the covid vaccine.
1/1	Yeah, I was watching this video because I have to a college poster presentation on it. I also read the Noble Prize article to get information on how the vaccine works. Incredible work they’ve done!
1/1	Yeah, a lot of antivaxers here in Lithuania too. Well, in EU it's restricted to discriminate them, but I don't understand these people. I know a lot of antivaxers in real life, and SOME of them (not all) don't want to get vaccinated for very... "strange" reasons (global government will kill us with poison, it's a plan to reduce human population, old people will die and young people will be infertile, virus doesn't exist, etc...)
1/1	Yeah, people need to understand that vaccines, while safe, can have side effects. Just like any other medications!
1/-1	Yeah, people will believe lots of things. Doesn't make them correct.
0/0	Yeah, that’s gonna be a “no” from me, dawg!
1/1	Yeah, there are risks. Just like crossing the street. But I’d rather take a tiny risk than end up in the hospital with COVID.
0/0	Yeah, they keep taking these shots because they took too many, their brains are inflamed and they have brain fog, they can't think straight. Most seniors are on the treadmill to their deaths thanks to these shots. We see them line up while those who are still sane enough avoid the shots because they haven't been threatened yet with job losses.
1/-1	Yeah, this is easily explained by social distancing and isolating... we have less contact with other more common viruses as well and the impacts can be stronger not only because of that, but because people have been indoors even more than usual (which was already probably too much across the board before the pandemic) and so they lack sufficient sunlight, which helps the immune system. When use brain properly, is good.
0/-1	Yeah. I had 2 shots and that’s the end of it for me.
1/1	Yeah. Just like flu shot now. Usually get em at the same time
1/0	Yeah. This experimental warp speed concoction is totally safe. That’s why you can’t sue the vaccine companies. Because they are safe. Headaches chills fever vomiting diarrhea. It’s normal.
1/-1	Yeah... Isn't that the whole theory behind vaccines? Vaccines just have the advantage that you don't have to get sick in the first place. And covid is nasty so i'd like to avoid it.
1/1	Yep got my Covid and flu a couple of weeks ago!
1/1	Yep just got mine last week. And a flu shot. Several people close to me have recently gotten Covid and thanks to the boosters they are all fine.
0/0	Yep me too got 1st dose November last year bow I have bad asthma all the time I'm not getting anymore shots
0/0	Yep my fathers in the hospital after this most recent booster. I’m still all natural. No vaccine for me.
0/0/0/1	Yep! You’ll definitely hear about it in the news, too. The shot last year was available by Sept. 20, I assume this year will be a similar timeframe. The new shot is going to target the JN. 1 strain of the virus - https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/updated-covid-19-vaccines-use-united-states-beginning-fall-2024 The three options will be Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax. The first two are mRNA, while Novavax is protein-based and apparently has milder side effects than the other two. I’ve taken Moderna and have stayed healthy the last few years despite going out maskless constantly, I’m assuming the shot has conferred me with a decent level of immunity each year.
0/0	Yep!!! This is a biological WEAPON !!!
1/1	Yep, I'll keep on getting them as well.
1/1	Yep, got mine on Monday. Novavax rocks. No achy miserable side effects this year!
1/1/1/1/1	Yep, just got my COVID and Flu shots a week ago, both in the same arm. I’ve done that the last few years ever since we started having boosters available. I’m so grateful for them.
1/-1	Yep, that vaccination has proven to work so well against getting g covid.
0/0	Yep,I refused it. Glad I did especially after hearing stories of injuries caused by the jab.
1/1	Yep. Every year with my flu shot. Why risk getting sick for weeks or even long-term health issues. I just got my COVID and flu shot a couple of weeks ago and just had some soreness for a day.
1/1	Yep. Got my annual Covid and flu shots last month when they became available. Most of my friends have gotten or will be getting them this fall too.
1/1	Yep. I am ready to get mine. I figure if Fauci got it then its good enough for me. As much as Mr POTUS pushed for it to be done i thought he would be first in line
1/1	Yep. That's pretty much the entire point of a vaccine. It's like building up an army with the proper weapons and gear before the war begins. Or, you can wait for your militia to be overrun by the invasion.
0/0	Yep...I lost my job and ended up on the streets but thankfully I don't have covid venom in my veins.
0/0	Yep?.already knew that?.before as well as during and after?..family members are sicker than me, the old fart,and wondering why but still think I know nothing and should get jabbed?. Not in this life.
1/1	Yes , of course . The whole world needs to get to herd immunity , and the way do that is through vaccinations .
1/1	Yes . And by telling others to not get vaccine she is putting her child at risk.
1/1	Yes I got all my vaccines the same day.
1/0	Yes I got both my Covid and flu shot this month!
1/1	Yes Marissa, your doctor doesn’t know your child in the way that you do... But doctors know better than bloggers.
1/-1	Yes Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!
0/1	Yes Trump did this but at the same time he backed Stargate which is developing mRNA vaccines for everyone. Expect your Medical Insurance to specify if you don't take the Vaccine designed for you your Insurance Company wont cover your medical costs. So nothing has changed in effect!!
0/-1	Yes a friend of mine has covid we were at a xmas party together Staturday night but so far so good no covid
0/0	Yes and I eat pink pancakes. No vaccine is safe. A vaccine in under a year is a joke. You can do little research to find out how useless flu vaccines are. For all of you getting the vax.. to a man made virus with a 99.8% survival rate ask your doctor about the vaccines ingredients, if you want fetus cells, Mercury and lead in your body then you deserve to have the vaccine.
1/1	Yes and timely vaccines!
1/1	Yes but 10x worse. You would likely end up in a hospital but with the vaccine you wouldn't even feel it
1/1	Yes but some people will believe conspiracy theories first and leave their children unprotected. SAD
1/1	Yes fragile people must be protected it is needed
1/1	Yes get the shot. Would you stop getting an annual flu shot because you got one 5 years ago? Or stop getting a rabies booster bc you had one 15 years ago?
1/1	Yes it will end the pandemic
1/1	Yes just like flu vaccines. Now they are available together.
0/0	Yes let’s take a rushed vaccine what could possibly go wrong
1/1	Yes of course. Got Novavax a few weeks ago. 💪
0/0	Yes of course. In Germany, they told us during Covid-19 that the vaccine manufacturers would not make any money with the Covid vaccine. Always the same stupid story.
1/1	Yes people do. I'm a nurse.
1/0	Yes ppl still get them. That person was confused.
1/-1	Yes that 0.3% death rate of covid is terrible....how many people has the vaccines saved btw???..
0/0	Yes they do, my 43 year old navy vet son, in perfect health, had a massive heart attack and died after his 4th forced jab of COVID.
1/1	Yes they should protect a little against infection I think it's like 50% but it does help keep you alive, out of the hospital, and hopefully free of developing Long CoVid. But none of these things are 100%. Basically you're better off getting the vaccine than not but you should still mask indoors especially during surges and be careful who you are around. This is how I understand it.
0/0	Yes tried and trusted vaccines should be used not experimental bullshit that is almost certainly killing people. I am Anti Covid 19 vaccine not AntiVax
1/1	Yes! Booked in for myself but more importantly others. Thanks for sharing
1/-1	Yes! My opinion on this is if your child or you had an adervse reaction to a vaccinine then tell people with caution. Theres nothing wrong with telling people the risks that could happen. I dont see why though they should discourage others to not get them.
1/-1	Yes!!!
1/1	Yes, I get them every year. I’ve never had Covid. I’ve read that Covid gets worse every time you have it, and that has been true for the people in my family who have had it a few times. No thanks.
1/1	Yes, I got both flu and Covid vaccinations two weeks ago. I usually don't have much of a reaction but one or both of these shots kicked my ass for an entire week. I can only imagine what the illness itself might do, so I'm really glad to have this layer of protection.
0/1	Yes, I got my COVID and flu vaccines together. I plan them for late afternoon on a Friday so I can have a do-nothing weekend and be ready for work Monday.
1/1	Yes, I got vaccinated! It’s about keeping the community safe.
0/0	Yes, I had a stroke after vaccine.
1/1/1	Yes, I have second dos vaccine of modern
1/1	Yes, I will continue to get a COVID vaccine and flu shot each year.
1/1	Yes, I work in healthcare and my employer is offering a bonus of 150 dollars for everyone who gets the vaccination. Thank you for the information.
1/1	Yes, I'll be getting it!
1/1	Yes, I've had six and will continue to get them. My two doses of C19 have been literally nothing more than a runny nose.
1/1	Yes, I’m getting mine this Friday.
1/1	Yes, I’m vaccinated this year! I feel it’s necessary.
1/1	Yes, I’ve gotten them every time they’ve been offered.
1/1	Yes, Mercury is in vaccines. However, it is NOT enough to harm your body. Also, guess what! Cyanide is in apples. Cyanide is a fast-acting, deadly poison. Yet, we are not dead, BECAUSE IT IS TOO SMALL TO HARM YOUR BODY. The government isn't lying to us. Vaccines are absolutely safe and prevent diseases.
1/1	Yes, and I've never had covid.
1/1	Yes, and I've never had covid. There's the slim possibility that I've had the version that doesn't cause symptoms, but it's not likely.
1/1	Yes, and the flu vaccine every year. I’m a nurse and I have an immunocompromised child.
1/1	Yes, and you should to. The vaccinations reduce the harm of becoming infected.
1/-1	Yes, and you're invited for a free government Vax if you're over 60 (in Holland). The boomer who spoke to you is the demographic who should get one, along with his flu Vax, but then, fox News
1/-1	Yes, but the bloody govt is limiting who gets the vax. Got asked so many questions about if I was eligible because I don't "look" like i am eligible. I'm diabetic.
1/1	Yes, covid is always mutating just like the flu. Would you stop getting your flu shot?
1/1	Yes, definitely Covid-19 vaccine is important for all of us.
1	Yes, everyone in the world should be vaccinated! Let it begin with you!
1/-1	Yes, how do you fix collective insanity. Not to mention people are being bombard by legit lies and fake news from these anti-vaccine groups. Media literacy should be a mandatory class in high school. This way people can learn to determine what is legit news vs true fake news.
1/1	Yes, if there had been better staffing so everyone could take the vaccine now that it is available!!
1/1	Yes, it's true, I got vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine first dose on August 25, 2021, and it’s true that the side effects of the vaccine in the arm that was injected will slightly feel heavy and hurt. You can also feel a slight heaviness and heat in your body, and also in your legs. After I was vaccinated, now I’m feeling ok and great, successfully vaccinated.
1/1	Yes, let's deny science because it's the only way some people can cope.
1/-1	Yes, like everything else that’s fucked up about America, even though Republicans are at the forefront and almost 100% responsible for the antivax movement in this country somehow it is Biden’s job to fix it.
1/1	Yes, not because I'm worried about Covid, but because I believe vaccines help strengthen the immune system. Like a scrimmage match in sports
1/1	Yes, of course. COVID is still very much around. I also get a yearly flu shot.
1/1	Yes, people may get infected, but the vaccine helps ameliorate the duration and damages of #COVID19
1/1	Yes, scientists wouldn't be foolish enough to let you inject something harmful into your body.
0/0	Yes, the covid gene therapy has made people distrust most vaccines entirely.
1/1	Yes, those who says masks doesn't work…
1/1	Yes, vaccines CAN cause side effects, but it's almost always mild (i.e mild fever, muscle soreness, especially in the vaccinated area, redness and swelling at the injection site(s), lethargy and headaches.) It's only severe in less than 1% of cases. It might hurt, but it'll be over quickly and your body, especially your immune system, will thank you.
1/1	Yes, we are still getting Covid shots. I go for flu every year anyway, so now I just get Covid and flu shots at the same time. Easy peasy.
1/1	Yes, when the new vaccine comes, I'll take the 4th.
0/1	Yes, yes, very safe! Start by vaccinating the most important people, the congress!
1/1/1	Yes, you should!
1/1	Yes. 37% is still better than nothing, but the biggest benefit is in reducing severity of symptoms and hospitalizations. I will be getting the shot as soon as LO is 6 months.
1/1/1	Yes. A friend died yesterday of Covid. Not vaccinated, otherwise health 40 something. Get vaccinated unless you can't for some reason.
1/1/1	Yes. And I need to get my flu shot soon. I should schedule that now
1/-1	Yes. Because I don’t like being sick.
0/0	Yes. Brilliant. So glad to see so many people are standing up for themselves. You are not selfish for refusing a medical procedure which has zero benefit to you and may even have irreversible harmful effects.
1/1	Yes. Covid is still an airborne vascular disease that has cumulative effects with each successive infection, even mild cases. Research shows that we still don’t know enough about long covid to warrant being laissez-faire about multiple infections. For example, we still don’t know why Covid infections in kids are associated with a rise in juvenile diabetes. Covid is still killing people. Vaccination has been demonstrated over and over again to reduce the risk of severe infection (expressed in the data as hospitalization) and death.
1/-1	Yes. Everyone I know. Entire family & all friends. Covid & flu
1/-1	Yes. Everyone I know. Entire family & all friends. Covid & flu.
1	Yes. Flu and Covid. October is a good time to get them - go for it!
1/1/1/1	Yes. Fully vaxxed. Never got COVID, always get the boosters.
1/1	Yes. Getting a flu shot- might as well throw in a covid shot too.
1/1	Yes. Got the latest one with my flu shot.
1/1	Yes. I don't like having my ass kicked by Covid.
1/1	Yes. I don’t see a reason to not do it; why not protect yourself and others?
1/1	Yes. I got mine Monday. And I got my flu shot. My mother is an antivaxer and I finally asked my pcp to do a titers test for me which revealed that I didn’t get my MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) shot. So I just got that too.
1	Yes. I hope everyone does. I've only been outside 4× since last Feb, 2020. I'm never gonna get to see my kids who live in the US (nor finally meet my now 8mo.old • first ever • grandchild!!) if people don't stop it with the anti-science shit. I'm on borrowed time here already. I have a few years left, & if people don't pull their heads out their ignorant arses? My last years on earth will be alone & heartbroken without the people I love more than life - my grown-up "babies".
1/1	Yes. I just got my flu shot and updated Covid vaccine three weeks ago. I have four little children so I try to stay my healthiest for them.
1/1	Yes. I stay up to date on my boosters. I've never tested positive in the past almost 5 years.
1/-1	Yes. I think I've had 5 in total since they first rolled out
1/-1	Yes. I’m extremely active in my church and of course we have a lot of older people. I also work in a warehouse and around lots of people that have kids.
1/1	Yes. I’ve gotten every one and will continue to do so.
1/1	Yes. My LO got it when he was eligible over the summer and it was a huge relief. Some protection is better than none and it's not like getting it now stops him from getting another one in the future.
1/1	Yes. My daughter had her first child 8.5 mos ago … I can’t be there yet. They’re my reason for living… so I’m willing to ‘risk’ a vaccine which has had exactly ZERO bad side effects thus far…
1/1	Yes. My family will get as soon as available to us.
1/1	Yes. My wife is immunocompromised, so my view on it is different than most. It's my job to help take care of and protect her My grandma has also been ravaged by long covid. She's never been the same and I'll never get to have Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner at her house because she just can't do it anymore. Covid robbed us of a lot of small joys and getting a vaccine once a year is a pittance to pay to fight against it.
0/0/0	Yes. People needed to be convinced, not mandated.
1/1	Yes. There’s just too many problems Covid and long COVID can cause to risk it.
1/1	Yes. Yes, yes, yes... I workn in a senior living community and most of the resudents watch Fox news and refuse vaccines. We have continued to have constant rolling outbreaks over the past 2 years.
1/1	Yes. You are still less likely to be hospitalized or die if you do get COVID. New COVID vaccine updated with the latest variants was just approved and will be available in September.
1/1	Yes... I'm alive ... spent months in hospital as a child with pneumonia and have never been able to get past a cold without a chest infection. 8 days into my post vaccine and positive COVID result I'm starting to do ok. There's no way I would have made it though without... it has been so brutal man, but I'm on the way out. If you're like me, just get it done man
1/1	Yess it's hard to get it here in third world countries, I'm just glad they give it for free. And I hope everyone who can't get vaccinated can stay safe and strong
0/0	Yesterday a coworker was talking about how she's still sick and has always been a person who would only get sick like once every six years and this year she's been sick several times. I made a comment about how I felt blessed that I haven't gotten sick once and haven't missed a day and it's May but I wasn't vaccinated. She twittered about how she had a newborn and because her newborn "had no immunity" she decided to get the vaccine. I made no more comment but the she just went on talking about all her sickness and how "WEIRD" it is, like we never even mentioned the vax and there could be no connection if we did. It was WEIRD. It kind of freaked me out....like I just watched a deceiving spirit put a plastic bag over her head. Just "la-la-la...anyway, I just don't know why I keep getting sick. I think it's because my immune system is still low after the pregnancy." They don't want to admit they screwed up their bodies and lives.
1/-1	Yesterday i got the first dose of Pfizer vaccine. First night who i sleep good after one year, thanks!
1/1	Yet these same people that refuse to trust doctors about vaccines will be the same people running to doctors for treatment
1/0	Yet these same people that refuse to trust doctors about vaccines will be the same people running to doctors for treatment….
0/0/0	Yet you're slowing down the third dose? That's remarkable!
0/0	Yet, when you ask a doctor or nurse if "vaccines are guaranteed to work keep you safe and strong" the answer is always NO. #VaccineScamAlert
0/0	Yip big pharma wants to make a lot of money again. Vaccine for it due soon probably already have some poison ready. The greed for money is unbelievable…
0	Yo.....for everyone who refused the Jab, despite the pressure......you scored the highest on the World Wide, IQ Test.
1/1	You NEVER say NEVER and you NEVER say ALWAYS. That's why the risk is LOW. But the chances that the benefits outweigh the risks are really HIGH. Get it? Comprende?
1/1	You WILL get the shot!
1/1	You actually save lives and prevent severe suffering by getting vaccinated against covid!
0/0	You all are more than welcome to do whatever you choose to your body. Not my body, not my business. I prefer to watch from a distance and let the kinks get worked out first. But that's me. I will take my chances with the virus.
1/1	You apparently do not understand either the basis of infectious immunity nor that of epidemiological methods of mitigation. Moral: it has been conclusively shown over maaany years regardless of vaccine "type" that mass vaccination reduces "morbidity" - which reduces the overall socioeconomic impact of infectious diseases to include mortality. Does every single person become "immune" - nope = and that is an unrealistic expectation and hence argument. Owing to idiopathic genetic variance as we are still individuals there are always some who do not react as most do. Still if enough are vaccinated the data shows incidence of the infectious disease in question drops = and can even halt altogether.
1/-1	You are BIG BRAIN. u believed in the vaccines and it payed off
0/0	You are NOT stickin me with that POISON!
0/0	You are all very well behaved obedient slaves. Congrats. They have a nicely put together visual aid and have a nice girls voice telling you something so you all feel happy
1/1	You are correct on there being a difference. Specifically, the two main vaccines for COVID-19 in the US (Pfizer and Moderna) are significantly safer than the yellow fever vaccine. Just because you don't understand the technology of an RNA vaccine doesn't mean they are unsafe.
1/-1	You are doing great with explaining the conspiracy theories stuff! Best channel on youtube so far!
0/0	You are no longer a free person if you cannot decide what goes into your own body. I thought no meant no!!
1/-1	You are only a victim of misinformation if that is the only info you have been presented with. If you have chosen to only pick and choose info that fits your own confirmation bias then you are not a victim.
1/1	You are probably having an allergic reaction to the vaccine, which is to be expected with some people. That doesn't mean the vaccine is immediately worthless/trying to kill people. Contact your doctor about it.
1/1	You are significantly reducing your chances of severe complications.
1/1	You are the types of people i hate the most you PROLONG the pandemic by not getting vaccinated and then you cry why does the pandemic take so long
1/1	You are thousands of times more likely to be hurt from diseases that vaccines would save you from than vaccines hurting you.
1/1	You are wise, Jonas, I wish everyone thought like you.I'm waiting to get my first injection myself.
1/-1	You ask a great question! I would think about this concept in terms of multiple simultaneous interactions between receptors and ligands. Some of those interactions are activating while others are inactivation. This is probably a huge oversimplification but spike proteins have specific motifs called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are recognized as foreign by toll like receptors on macrophages and dendritic cells. Additionally your body's cells express human leukocyte antigens that tell your body immune system they are not foreign. Yes our immune cells will destroy and process any cells that produce spike proteins but only do so because of the presence of the spike protein. Basically your body's cells have "lots" of receptors to tell the immune system not to attack them. In regards to autoimmune diseases one would have to know specifically where that break down in communication takes place but I imagine the scientists who developed the vaccine have this in mind.
1/0	You big mad. Just be happy there are two more vaccinated people in the world and move on with your pathetic life.
1/1	You can get vaccinated at your nearest pharmacy. I took my grandchildren and my parents . We were all vaccinated at the same time and not one of us got sick after
1/-1	You can have my dose MSNBC. Please take it and give it to Richard Maddow.
0/0	You can have my vaccine.
1/1	You can protect against severe COVID-19 disease with vaccination.
0/0	You can put me down as a NO Effing Way!
0/-1	You can save humanity By simply staying at home and do absolutely nothing
1/1	You can still get Covid after vaccination, but it would very possibly not be as severe, which could mean life saving. I am fully vaccinated, feeling ok with the vaccines.
0/0	You can stop pushing it - nobody wants it.
1/0	You can tell the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Doctor is trying so hard to be respectful for the anti-vaxxers, and you can see the sadness in his eyes about their opinions and how it can affect the greater good.
0/0	You can't blame us anti-vaxxers, our own CDC has experimented on us in not so distant history. This causes mistrust which is deepened when you see that doctors are also one of the highest vaccine hesitant groups.
0/0	You can't force people to take medications.... RESIST RESIST RESISt !
1/1	You cannot expect 100% of vaccines to work in 100%of cases 100% of the time. NOTHING is that perfect, sadly. But, if everyone was vaccinated you’d get the herd method (google it) which would protect others
1/1	You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccines we have now and the ones in development contain only bits of virus mRNA or protein to trick the body into mounting a defense that prevents real infection.
0/-1	You cannot prove it because they give multiple shots at the same time. By design.
0/0	You can’t sue the manufacturers if something goes wrong—why would I trust this?
1/0	You could always wait until you have either died from Covid, or else been left disabled by it.
1/-1	You could say that about any vaccine even the flu shot! Why is the media putting fear into people that really need this!
0/1	You do know a vaccine does not prevent a person from catching Covid??? It only helps build your resistance so that symptoms will be milder and/or less noticeable
1/1	You don't have the freedom to infect other people's children.
0/0	You don't know that the vaccine is safe. You're a human petri dish
0/0	You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to spot that there's a conspiracy.
0/1	You don't see the acute association because it takes a few weeks after the second shot for the neurological decline to begin. And it doesn't necessarily kill you.
1/1	You don't think it's fair to make fun of them but many of us didn't think it was funny to make fun of us for taking precautions and for putting us at risk. So it's actually quite fair imo.
1/1	You don’t get to refuse a vaccine and then beg for medical help when you get sick. Actions have consequences. 🚨
1/1	You don’t get vaccinated for to protect yourself, you do it to protect your families and loved ones!
0/0	You don’t have to take it it’s your right as a human to refuse. It’s nobody else’s body but your own. I don’t want this shot myself ever either. It’s your choice nobody shouldn’t be pressuring you against your will to take it. Don’t listen to the yelling people they got nothing better to do then make there own ears bleed.
1/1	You don’t wanna be a lab rat, but you trust random internet supplements?
1/1	You don’t want a vaccine? Then get the hell out of the bed and let some patient who wants to get help
1/1	You drank Four Loko and ate Tide Pods but NOW you care about "health risks"?

0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	You forgot to mention the heart attacks people are getting... Good job at not being biased!!
1/1	You get more LONG-TERM HEALTH issues from COVID than you do any vaccine. Ever live with no smell or taste????
1/1	You got those tattoos in a sketchy Albanian shop but are scared of a medically tested vaccine?
0/0	You guys are brain washing everybody watching you about vaccine being good.
0/0	You guys take the vaccine youtube will be a better place for it, I don't want the Melinda vaxx and Gates final solution.
0/0	You have control group, just studying Amish children who haven’t been subjected to any childhood vaccinations!
1/1	You have some protection against infection for the first 4 months after a vaccination, but it begins to wane then and is mostly gone by 6 months. Protection against severe illness lasts longer. As the virus changes, the immunity that we have from previous vaccines and infections is less good, the new updates are based on newer variants and so they are most effective, but it's not that you have zero protection. https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/a-guide-to-fall-2024-vaccines
1/1	You have to think of a vaccine like showing your army (immune system) a photo of the bad guys. Some bad guys may get through, but that extra intel should keep them from destroying your base and/or using it to attack other bases.
1/1	You have to use the seat belts if you want to drive. Get vaccinated if you want to go outside!
1/0	You just convinced me to not be picky about vaccines. Thank You
0/1	You keep them a million miles away from it.
0/0	You keep your vaccines , be a cold day in hell before I do!!
0/0	You know what else increased during this time span? You guessed it, it causes autism.
1/1	You know what’s a shit load less dangerous than covid? The vaccine, even in oversized incorrect doses. We are never getting rid of this thing because of you anti vaccine chuckle heads and I’m So over it.
0/0	You know, there was no COVID virus--it was just an excuse to administer the deadly jabs. If we all just understand at the very top there is complete evil, we will reach the right conclusions.
1/1	You like banging hot chicks? Can’t do that if you’re dead …. Vaccinations help not being dead. Tl;dr. Get vaccinated, bang hotties. Profit.
1/1	You literally just proved my point: vaccines are so effective that people aren't dying from it as much as they used to
1/1	You may choose not to get vaccinated yourself, but at least be responsible for your family!
0/0	You may die from myocarditis - this is normal, don't be concerned. You may develop an auto-immune disorder - once again, this is a normal side-effect.
0/0/0	You mean like the Covid vaccine that didn’t do a goddamn thing to prevent Covid and killed people? That’s not “life saving technology.”
0/0	You mean the billions of people who died from the vaccine right? My friend's cousin worked with over a dozen people who died from the vaccine but the media refuses to report on it. /s
0/0	You must be joking I’m vaccine free and plan to stay that way
1/1	You must live in the south. Personally, I don't want any anti Vax medical personnel touching me or my loved ones.
1/0	You obviously don’t get the point. I don’t agree with mandates, but those of us older folks are better off vaccinated than unvaccinated. You do you and let the rest of us do what works for us. You’re not the person to be preaching to others.
1/1	You people have no idea how fortunate you all are for having available vaccines for everyone in your country....While all of us are suffering waiting when the vaccine will be available for us…
0/-1	You people killed me! So evil, and disgusting. What you didn't realize is that your Karma is coming!

1/1	You people refusing the vaccine are a bunch of chicken sh.. !! probably going to regret later on when youre on a ventilator and wondering how you got there!!
1/1	You refuse the vaccine but take horse dewormer? 🤡
1/1	You risk death to get the "Natural Immunity". In theory, the vaccine risk is lower.
0/0	You said it perfectly! Better than I could! I absolutely agree with you on every point. It’s sad that people can’t accept that we have had bad side effects from the vaccines and gaslight us into thinking it wasn’t from the shots. My own neurologist told me the vaccine caused my flare up!
0/-1	You say that people are hesitant because of misinformation, but you literally said in the video that there isn’t any info on long term side effects. How is this not a huge reason to be hesitant?
0/0	You should be afraid of this vaccine. People blindly follow an experimental drug and just because the people at the top say its safe and effective.
1/1	You should get a booster shot every three to six months until the global outbreak ends.
0	You should have heard Gates speech about it I did and I ️like the devil was chasing me!!!!!!
0/0	You should regret it. If you would have used common sense and critical thinking, you would have realized it wasn't a good thing.
1/1	You should. If you compare risks and benefits of the mRNA-based covid-19 vaccines and the risks and benefits of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2
0/0	You still haven't answered my question about the scientific basis on which you base your advice and recommendations? And no, I don't want links to your website.
1/1	You take your vitamins and cattle drench and I will stick with the vaccine. We will see who needs the ventilator!
1/0	You think that if the people in the 1800s were told there’s a vaccine that will prevent you from getting it or dying from it they would pass up on it? These diseases have literally been eradicated because of vaccines.
1/1	You think the vaccine is dangerous? Try COVID.
0/-1	You took four shots and still got sick? LOL!
1/0	You took shots at the bar, but a vaccine is where you draw the line? 🤦♂️

1/-1	You've got 2 choices. Vaccinate, or herd immunity. Take your pick. You'll do one or the other, no matter how many doctors you put on here.
0/0	You've no regard for the facts which are clear that the vaccine has devastated the health of a significant portion of Americans including deaths. Wake up -
0/0	Your "data" is incorrect. It's not proven safe and it's definitely ineffective..
1/-1	Your Mom is smart
0/0	Your body already has the knowledge to build immunity. It is born with it. These vaccines destroy your bodies ability to build its own immunity. Go ahead and be a Guinea pig. Your a fool.

0/0	Your vaccine is not safe It takes 15 to 20 years and animal trials before they put it in human trials for another 15 to 20 years just to make sure there is no bad side effects down the Line now if you vaccinate everybody and find out that everybody dies down-the-line whose fault is that gonna be The people that don't do the research should be the government for pushing it and making people lose their lives
1/1	You’ll be fine. Like the billions of other people who took the vaccine.

0/0	Yup. Me too.1 month already feeling soooo bad...After gettin vax
1/-1	Yup. My career requires me interacting with clients on a regular basis, plus I have two small kittens at home. Also, I just hate being sick no matter how mild it is.
1/0	Y’all anti vaxxers don’t have to get it, it’ll go to people who want and need it more. You guys can get covid and get your bodies destroyed if you want that so badly. I’m not gonna wear a mask just to protect you guys when you guys don’t wanna do something that can ultimately help you and help us end the pandemic. These things are tested and proven to work. They are approved by the freakin FDA. Unless you have medical history, you should do all the research possible and really think about getting this. I’m not saying you just get it, but think about it completely and make an informed decision in the end instead of automatically going against it, or come the next wave, we’ll have to lock down for years
0/0	Y’all are crazy to take this vaccine I would never

0/-1	Zero credibility.
1/1	a promising vaccine to tackle the virus outbreak. Hope that majority of the general population will adopt it...? in the mean time urgent to keep social distancing
1/0	a very effective vaccine that did what it was supposed to would not make me not want to use them.
0/-1	absolute lie
1/1	absolutely ingenious! those who had the mind to manipulate mRNA in such a way deserve respect.
1/-1	absolutely. I get the flu shot every year, so I get the Covid one too. Why risk getting sick? Everyone in my family gets one, and I see people (especially older people) getting Covid shots at the pharmacy
1/1	accination does not mean you avoid the virus completely, it just means you prime your immune system to recognise it as soon as possible, given what the immune system learned from the vaccine. In the case of variants, the thing your immune system learned may not have been optimal for the newest variant, so it might be slower detecting the virus, but not as slow as not having the vaccine. This means a reduced load on hospitals and ICU, and the biggest chance you can give people to survive getting sick, which is what the vaccine ultimately was supposed to do. The virus is here to stay, you will get sick of variants popping up every year, so you will need booster shots, just as with the yearly flu shot.
1/1	accination is important for your immunity and to protect you from this deadly virus.
0/0	actually some countries have banned certain COVID vaccines.
1/1	after vaccination, the vaccines reduced hospitalization risk by about 30%
0/0	ah... i'm a "healty" 23 y. old , no vaccine for me until (maybe) 2022?
1/1	all I can say is that my brother wanted to wait at since "long term effects were not known". He got Covid and needlessly suffered for two months, and still have long Covid symptoms.
0/0	all you should need to know it all about the money 💰 they are lying to you have been for years !
0/0	also, most people who got the vaccine tested positive for a variant of CV. What it did was cause mutations of the CV. Meanwhile, most of us that did not take it, had no symptoms or only lost taste and smell. That is natural immunity. Never mess with natural immunity if it is unnecessary. CV causes inflammation. What do you do to combat inflammation? You eat foods and drink teas that are anti-inflammatory. Supposedly, it was the ventilators that caused the most harm if you catch my drift. I cannot confirm that but I talked to a nurse here in Houston and she said she saw more patients with UTI than she did with CV, but viruses thrive better in cold dry weather than in warm humid weather.
1/1	and I 100% pro vaccine,my religion told me to protect health of myself and the health of others,so Vaccine is the answer

0/0	any attempt to mandatorily vaccinate me will be a fatal encounter
0/0	anyone who had the jab, had to be mad, not tested properly, and it was all to make a few companies super rich, I know 3 people personally who died within months of having the jab, fit people.
1/1	appreciate how the vaccine has allowed me to resume parts of my normal life without constantly worrying about the virus
1/1	approve ASTRAZENECA
0/1	as someone who's not taking it he's right. he recommends taking it but says we're free to make our own decision which is how it should be

0/-1	been hearing a lot of covered up death rates after taking the vaccine. anyone have any thought on that claim ?
0/0	being anti-covid vaccine doesn’t mean being antivax in general. Vaccines for Measles, Mumps, and Rubella - or injections you get at a young age - have been monitored and studied since their introduction in the 60s and 70s.

0/0	coronavirus is not that bad, even God made it and saw it was good! so, we can conclude that we are just the only reason of this pandemic, weve been distant to nature, we consume junkfoods and cigarettes, which must be removed by the government if they really want immunity, and , we live with polluted places such as. cities
0/0	count me in too. im now an antivaxxer.

0/0	explicitely explained in 4 words: absolutely useless toxic garbage
0/0	f it works, why do vaxxed people still get sick?
1/-1	fantastic remark! I’m going back through the past few years of content created around this topic and as an unvaccinated individual met thousands of people in my normal job and never got sick. I cleaned my hands and was careful but most of all, was taking a stance for me myself not for others. Everyone deserved their own right to this choice to get vaccinated. Anyway, loved this response and been watching hundreds of videos enjoying your comment greatly among many of the others.
1/1	feeling very nervous before the shot Just got my first dose. The process was smooth, and I'm feeling great ....I hope everything works well for others to0oo.......
1/1	finally got my first dose!
1/1	first shot, got a stiff arm for a day. Just got my second one two days ago. Got really tired around 8 PM, went to bed and woke up feeling super sick at around 1 PM the next day. Essentially went into coma. Today I feel a little sick and have taken a few naps. I rarely get sick but when I do I get hit hard, so I'm not surprised at my bodies reaction. Get your shot, stay safe.
1/1	follow doctor advice follow WHO clearly explained about the vaccine
1/1	for me: Pfizer is the best
0/0	for some reason... where I live people don't want to be vaccinated... and still do they are fine until now
0/0	for those ppl who are saying vaccines worked in stopping viruses in the past...well hold on a second did you know if a virus is too deadly that strain of that virus because less and less. when the virus kills the host then that virus dies because virus NEED a living host. the more deadly a virus is the faster it negatively select against itself eventually leading to its extinction. take that into account when you assume it was a vaccine that stopped a virus. vaccines dont do anything. if your immune system is strong enough to have a proper immune response against a vaccines then it can be strong enough to have a proper response against the real thing. and if your immune system is not strong enough to have a good immune response for the vaccines then it doesn't matter because vaccines only work when your immune system is strong enough to respond in the first place.
0/0	four of my friends got Pfizer , fully vaccinated and now are fully sick with the Variant. The vaccines do not work on the variants. Wake up folks.

1/-1	how about the many people who died in 2021 who didn't get vaccinated. That was the earlier variant. I know two healthy people in their mid 50s who suffocated in the hospital for about 5 months before they died. Take your chances, but it's on you.
1/1	how are the so called "vaccine-skepticals" so shameless?
0/0	how could they fooled and lie to so many is beyond me, all bs, all data miscalculated and people still willing to take vax, where's ms. wolensky from CDC now??? she was so smart how this vax is so efficient and would stop you from getting and spreading covid, hahahah, all lie, BS
0/0	how dare these people to decide on their own to take something in their bodies
0/0	how did the time table shoot from 12-18 months to less than 1 year? Plenty of articles in March/April saying it would be risky pushing out a vaccine quickly..
0/0	how do you explain the fact that so many people died from taking them? Dont delete my comment now.

0/0	i can't even move my back the day i took the 2nd dose..
1/1	i did the vaccine this summer in july. First dose,nothing felt. Second dose, i was having chills and fel cold,and i was a little nauseas so i didn't eat anything that day. but it lasted only one day.

0/0	i do feel for these people who are gona take it
0/0	i dont have even 1 vaccine,still fine
0/0	i dont think it is accurate. I am a trucker and most of my trucker friends did not get the shot. AND we stayed out driving across country hauling good and toilet paper while my sister bunkered down and locked herself away for 2 years. I am NEVER going to take an experimental drug because they "mandate" it. My governor said screw that!
0/0	i don’t trust the government’s handling of the vaccine rollout.
0/0	i feel like its probabaly some placebo they made instead of vaccines, i would take it had it been through years of testing. but 8 months not soo much
0/-1	i feel nauseous and almost vomited. i’m dizzy getting chills, and i passed out for a second everything went black and i almost fell over, it hurts😢

1/1	i get one every year and i still got covid last year but guess what? i didn’t die. thanks modern science and paxlovid. covid and respiratory stuff goes right for my lungs so i always get a flu shot and now an annual covid shot.
1/1/1/1/1/1	i get one every year and i still got covid last year but guess what? i didn’t die. thanks modern science and paxlovid. covid and respiratory stuff goes right for my lungs so i always get a flu shot and now an annual covid shot. this year i got both at the same time and first time i ever had a reaction. not full blown reaction but enough for the pharmacist ti tell me ti get some benadryl and next year i’ll do them separately.
1/1	i got covid after being vaccinated with pfizer and having some antibodies from my first bout of covid back in february of 2020. soooooo much easier of a time after first infection and being vaccinated! glad y’all are feeling better
1/1	i got covid this week and was MISERABLE. i'm vaccinated and boosted. i can't even imagine what it would have been like if i got it less than two years ago when i wasn't.
1/1	i got mine, please don't be afraid to get vaccinated.
1/1	i got my vaccine 2 days ago (note that its a 5-11 vaccine). Idk if this is abnormal but i had no side effects. Not even my arm was sore-

1/1	i had it a week ago no side effects
1/1	i had moderna too!! was very happy with my decision as i had covid a few weeks ago and did not experience many symptoms,
0/-1	i had my 1st shot.. i had no weird feelings at all except for the tinderness is the arm area where i was injected.. tbh, i am afraid to have my second dose,. for some reasons i have this feeling that it's risky. :(
0/0	i had the covid shot, and a few months later I got covid. the vaccine might have helped some, but Thousands got covid after vaccinations. This vaccine was not even pre tested. Not like it should have. i am more liberal, than conservative, BUT I'm do believe this man will do good RFK Jr. Will do a good job. Quit worrying about the vaccinesbr.Worry about BIG Pharma, other situations, millions of taxpayers wasted money on massive animal testing, the exposure of hidden waste , getting a more honest appraisal of health issues. i like Sanders, Covid can never be proved right or wrong.

0/-1	i hate twitter there are millions of people being adversely affected by this. Millions.
1/1	i have a 2020 covid baby. we got him vaccinated as soon as it became available, like the very first day. there were zero side effects. i would 100% vaccinate as soon as possible. we got covid for the first time this month (we masked until february of this year) and he was asymptomatic. he’ll get his booster this fall when it’s released. i cried when get got his vax, out of relief. it had been 2 years of strict quarantine and missing out on life.

1/1/1	i know people who were saved by vaccination.
1/0	i love how the lady in the beginning said she had family members injured by vaccines but never gave any proof or even explained it at all
0/0	i never got the vac because i have a fear of needles. also never got covid. im not a crazy person who thinks theres stuff in em but were they even needed for avarage ppl?
1/1/1	i still dont get how in all my 3 shots i had no side effects
0/0	i sure do enjoy how people dont specify the mrna aspect of a vaccine and just pretend its the same like all the inactive/live sample vaccines prior to it....
0/0	i think that each jab whatever is in it is a little dose of whatever is in it and that is why people are affected in different ways and time but the more of the dose the stronger it becomes and the worse it gets for the people. i think it does something to a lot of people's brains
0/-1	i took astra i wasnt anti vax but after both doses ive a huge bald patch on the side of my head
0/0	i usally dont comment about this but this video is not true i had covid back in 2020 and i didnt get any of the vaccines and my body build Immunity to the virus and i only had it two times and i dont get the virus and im around sick people all the time
0/0	i was able to stop my mom dad me and my brother f from taking third jab. greatful i was able to stop it from getting third
0/0	i was already skeptical of "ALL vaccines," the C19 vax didn't make me more so
1/1	i was down for 2 whole days after second vaccine. at that time i was in bad shape, and i was happy i got it. if i got the real infection, it would have been much much worse. so better to suffer for 2 days than in breathing help machine for months.
1/1	i was vaccinated and had it again after. I felt much better after being vaccinated. I believe in science and work in Healthcare.

0/-1	idk but The vaccine doesn't fully prevent transmission.
1/1	idk, it’s pretty karmically hilarious that these people got what was coming to them.
1/-1	if anti vaxxers don't want to take the vaccine then just don't take it. at that point, it's not anyone's problem or fault except yours if you get sick.
1/1	if big pharma and the government wanted to poison us, why are they so opposed to smoking indoors? Why are menthols on the chopping block? Why isn't fentanyl use encouraged?
1/1	if getting two quick shots means I don’t have to worry about a deadly virus, sign me up every time
1/1	if it makes you feel better i got pregnant 7 months after i got the vaccine and i now have a healthy baby and had a healthy pregnancy
0/0	if it’s so safe and effective, why did they have to mandate it?
0/-1/-1	if the Covid 19 vaccines started researching when I was born (December 10th, 2009), it will be done researching on February 26, 2018 and done testing on April 6, 2022, using the 20th-century method.
0/0	if there was at least one fatal case and there were more, no one has the right for anyone to be forced to risk his life !!!!!! I personally will not risk and wait for the situation to develop, and in any compulsion, I will firmly say that I am afraid and in such a situation I do not have - unless by force of the right to force me to vaccinate
1/1	if we are vaccinated, it mean there are less chances to be affected and hospitalization.
1/1/1	if we could get everybody vaccinated ... it would be a lot better
1/1/0	if we were perfect we wouldn't have any diseases but here we are.. god gave us the means of creating immunity

0/0	if you don't get it,you will have a better life ,instead of dying or severe symptoms.
1/1	if you dont get vaccinated it will cause you more grief then necessary in the future. stop trying to "take a stand" and just get it
1/1	if you get a flu shot, you can still catch the flu however you will not have as severe symptoms. same as covid vaccine...
0/0	if you get covid after the shot whats the point of the vaccine shot
1	if you had a side effect, then that means, congratulations, you already had an immune system that would have fought off the virus. thats gone now. rip

0/0	im in Thailand I caught COVID in the first few weeks of it being noticed, I trusted my immune system and after all this time I NEVER got it again despite being exposed to it (and its variants) in my family - THANK YOU MY IMMUNE SYSTEM - I WORRIED NOT - FOR ALL THAT TIME WHILE YOU GUYS WENT NUTZAND PANICKED -
1/1	im no doctor but my doc said pfizer was good so i got that. funny how many ppl have become MDs with this covid outbreak lol.
0/0	im not a guinea pig, no thanks
1/1	im not anti vaccine but i was anti second and third dose. i got corona and i didn't even feel sick so i probably did not more shots after the first one. in fact i haven't even been sick since, its almost like corona made my immune system even better
1/1	im pro vaccine, i think anti-vaxxers are dumb for not taking them. But imagine making this video after "The VarUs!!". How dare you suggest vaccines can ever be possibly be even slightly harmful?!? lol Seriously, its nuts how unscientific people have become, where they wanted healthy young adults to take an experimental vaccine without years of research? For high risk cases, absolutely worth the minute risks. But there are minute risks even to well research vaccines, let alone something with less than a year of testing. I mean they are most likely safe, and i would take it if i had health issues that would make covid lethal to me like obesity of respiratory issues, but outside of that, no. Politics ruins everything, even science.
1/1	im so happy that all my friends are vaccinated and not as stupid as these fools
0/0	imagine believing in covid. LOL
0/-1/-1	in a hurry with everyone paid off
1/1	in my view the three vaccines are highly effective in stopping disease and have no apparent risk profile different from any other vaccine. I would take any of them as soon as they are available.
0/0	informed choice: you may get GBS and if you do, you will be told "not related" and given no compensation, instead you will lie in a bed and struggle to walk for years -do you still want the shot?
1/-1	inject this content straight into my veins
1/1	irresponsible people need to get their act together!!!!!!! take responsibility-get vaccinated!
1/1	irst, vaccines do not guarantee you won't get a disease it protects against. They do though reduce your chances of contacting the disease. Second, the COVID vaccines you received were for the original strain. Many mutations have occurred since then which have reduced the effectiveness. Just like the flu. Third, we know from clear evidence and studies that the vaccines are significantly reducing the severity of illness if you do contract COVID after vaccination.
1/1	is anyone else here (besides me) in favour of mandatory/forced vaccination? I personally take the view that dialogue with these people is mostly useless, they do not wish to discuss in good faith and meanwhile they are putting us and our kids at risk. freedom is fine but it may be that to save lives we'll have to strap people down and make them take it wether they want it or not. just my two cents
1/0	is there any reason I should hold off? I mean, yes. If you did have Covid then a vaccine now would be useless and you would be theoretically be better off if you waited three months to get a boost of protection before the holidays. However without any evidence of an infection, I can see why your doctors have thrown their hands up as they really have no evidence to base a decision.
0/0	is this vaccine the governments way of sneakily injecting the world with the id chip no one wants, wouldn't put it past them after the continuous lies they keep forcing on us
0/0	it I’m nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I’m only 26.
0/1	it always has to be falsifiable any pseudoscience will have a convenient twist that always makes it non-falsifiable for example if i give this person a source of a doctor who is non-silenced well of course he's gonna say well no that doctor is bribed and the actual doctors that know the "truth" they are really silenced so no matter what proof you bring forward it will always be "debunked" by this kind of claim by this very convenient twist that also of course can't be proven you can't prove that something doesn't exist it's kind of it's kind of difficult so this is the very definition of pseudoscience if someone makes a claim that can't be debunked with whatever you bring to the table they always have a convenient excuse this goes for so many things in the world this goes for anti-vaxxers it goes for flat earth all these kind of things if it's not falsifiable it's not a scientific claim because you can make a claim like that for any singular thing in the world i can say oh the world is a square and anyone who tells you differently is silenced or bribed there you go how are we gonna prove someone isn't bribed it's like impossible and that's henceforth not a scientific claim -The Click
0/0	it f up my immune system so hard it start eating my cartilage, im still young and i have a joint problem 😢
1	it has nothing to do with the government...only modern day science ans medical facts.
1/1	it is especially important to get your vaccine if you are ages 65 and older, are at high risk for severe covid-19, or have never received a vaccine.
0/0	it is not a vaccine. a vaccine does more than POSSIBLY REDUCE SYMPTOMS.
0/0	it is obvious that these serums do not help. My question is how long this scam will last
0/0	it killed my father and as of April this year the vaccine has killed more than 50,000 in Europe alone
1/-1	it literally It reduces the risk of long COVID? shut the fuck up
0/-1	it reconfirms my fears that these Covid vaccines are even more dangerous that I had imagined.........
0/-1	it saved nobody but harmed and killed loads of people.
1/-1	it scares me bc i have a fear of needles but if it’s helps i’m all for it
1/1	it started as a pandemic, it is now also an IQ test
1/1	it was a no brainer for my little one to get the vaccine, we are good now,
0/0	it was all a hoax from the start they did not care nobody cared to and if they did they lost their job tut tut. they will have their reward for their actions on the next life.
1/1	it's also people's choice to choose not to be associated with someone like you who has not been vaccinated
1/1	it's amazing how technology changes everything
0/0	it's designed to kill people in six years
0/0	it's hard to trust a doctor who only sees your child for 10 minutes twice a year, i do not want to kill my kid by vaccinating him.
1/1	it's hard to trust someone with 0 medical experience who gets all of their information from Facebook posts and anecdotes over medical professionals who are encourage implementation of vaccines
1/1	it's important to note that scientific consensus overwhelmingly supports the safety and effectiveness of authorized COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death.
0/0	it's not safe and effective
1/1/1/1	it's sad that ppl actually think that vaccines r harmful
1/0	its a lower chance to be harmed by the vaccine than it is the virus get your facts straight

1/-1	just admit you admire chlna
0/1	just don't get the vaccine that's the healthiest way
0/0/0/0	just google it. uk vaccine side effects. of course the way they are spinning it is these are not caused by the vaccine. i guess its just a coincidence the deaths occurred during late stage trials, and the facial paralysis after vaccinations. and im sure they will tell u long term effects, if any, are in no way connected to the vaccine either.
1/1	just got my first dose of the pfizer one today. my anxiety has been getting to me about all the what ifs but i feel so much better after watching this
0/0	just let your child's immune system develop naturally and save them a lifetime of pain gained from side effects of the vaccine
0/1	just wait until Gates forces an update on your intercellular microchip, and you reach the blue screen of death crash mode.

0/-1	killers
0/0	know this is an older post, but that is personally the biggest regret of my life. I am 36 yrs old female, prior to the 💉I felt healthy, strength trained, now I feel like my body is deteriorating, my left arm always feels numb, if I am over active my body literally goes into shock, so much pain in every joint and muscle, I get these electric feeling zaps going up my spine, to my neck and brain, my vision has never been the same, nor has my cognitive ability, my brain fog is so bad. just don’t feel like this is normal 😔 I was never on board to get the vaccine, but was kinda pressured and I wish I had stood my ground and waited at least a year to make that decision and I know that by then I would’ve said no. It was a moment of weakness, and now all I can do is put my life on Jesus hands. With all this being said, I am glad that at least my husband and I were smart enough to not give it to our son who is still a teenager in development. Also never got boosted. My best advice is to Pray to god and stay strong
1/1	knowing I'm protecting my loved ones makes the small side effects totally worth it.
1/1	knowing we are helping to protect the most vulnerable in society from this virus is a wonderful feeling
1/1	knowledge is power!!

0/0	let me share an other story that happened in an other country, Greece. it was last April when our government (Greek government)said that all the teachers, professors should get vaccinated.the principal of my son's high school was one of the first who did the vaccine.he never came back to school we learned that when he did the vaccine didn't felt well and he was hospitalised .then a month later we learned that he was brain dead and he passed away. i think the two cases are similar.
1/-1	let's all pray that the Vaccine will be safe may the force be with us
1/0	let's get vaccinated to save more heartache
0/-1	let's put it this way. NO nurse should be let anywhere near a patient with an mrna jab.
1/1	literally losing brain cells from reading anti vaxxers comments omg
1/1	live in a tropical country, you’ll be thankful for vaccines.

0/0	lol I don’t care who he is.. I’m never getting another vaccine.
1/1	lol my arm was sore for like a day but honestly? worth it. rather that than bein stuck in bed for 2 weeks
0/0	lol never putting that shit in my body ever
0/0	lol no, haven’t since 2021 and have no interest in ever getting another
1/0	lol she said “they’re safe-ish” do a doctor who went to college whilst she did her “own research”
0/0	lol the vaccines aren't ending the pandemic they are just creating more variants. Some of the most vaccinated nations in the world are seeing their highest infection rates ever. I have no doubt they reduce the severity of symptoms but something doesn't sit right with me about needing a booster every 5 months for the mRNA shots.
0/0	lol yeah lets change the DNA of all Humans, that can't possibly go wrong XD
1/-1	lol, I can tell nearly 5k people disliked the video without watching it. They just went "dYsToPiAn CoNfoRmiTy" and then moved on to some other well researched video to rant on.
1/1	look... nearly a BILLION people are FULLY VACCNATED. i could understand some skepticism at the very beginning, but how can you be hesistant against something that a billion other people have already done, and come out the other side of totally fine (and clearly protected).
0/0	looks like the unvaxxed already won by the new nuumbers released
0/0	lots of nasties in these jabbs
1/1	love how anti-vaxxers got COVID and suddenly trusted the hospital real fast
0/-1	lucky there are still some purebloods to carry the species.
1/1	mRNA = Microsoft Rapid Nanochip Access Just kidding, vaccines are not bad :)
0/0/0	mRNA death jab bioweapon. It is not a vaccine and should never, ever be referred so. They literally had to redefine the word vaccine so they could apply it to the bioweapon.
0/-1	mRNA explained? If it's on Vox and YouTube you just know we are getting the full truth with no lies, right? 🤪👈
0/0	mRNA is NOT a vaccine category. it inserts a gene instruction INTO our DNA and to create Covid Antigens. very dangerious. our gene DNA is changed
1/-1	mRNA needs additional enzymes and chemical signals to access the cell&#39;s DNA, let alone change it. <br><br>And none of these DNA altering components are present in mRNA vaccines
1/1	mRNA tech is a game changer. Future pandemics? Bring it on.
1/1	mRNA tech isn’t new, it’s been studied for decades. Do some research!
0/0	mRNA technology has never been tested for a long time, and we have become a global experiment.
0/0	mRNA technology has never worked - animal trials all failed
1/1	mRNA technology is an incredible scientific breakthrough.
1/1	mRNA vaccines are NOT new types of vaccines... they have been around for years. All vaccines can have side effects... all medication has side effects..... Tylenol can have deadly consequences....and it doesn't require blatant misuse in some people... should it be removed from the market? How about reading real research instead of getting info from tictok or the enquirer
1/1	mRNA vaccines aren’t experimental anymore. They’ve saved lives.
1/1	mRNA vaccines don’t use an actual virus BTW. Even vaccines that do use a weak or inactive virus are much safer than catching the actual virus while being unvaccinated.
0/0	mRNA vaccines have NEVER been used on humans before
1/1	mRNA vaccines have been tested before and they are safer. I believe in this vaccine
0/0	majority of the people that i have heard going to the hospital in the past few months have all been vaccinated against covid 19 and are experiencing terrible symptoms.
1/-1	me my wife and children took corona vaccine and we had a fever for few hours or a day but no major side effect

0/0/0/0	my bus driver got vaxxed n died 3 weeks later
0/0	my child has had an adverse reaction to vaccines earlier, so I wont risk it by getting him vaccinated against covid.
0/0	my children don't take new meds or vaccines
0/0	my close friend had a vaccine she got too many:; side effects so I wont take vaccination::::
1/1	my dad died of covid. had he gotten the vaccine he'd probably still be here. goes both ways.
1/1	my dad was fully healthy, no underlying issues...59 years old. tested positive for covid on 4/4 and passed away on 4/8 unexpectedly. perhaps he had the covid pneumonia. he had just retired and was turning 60 in september. he leaves behind his first grand daughter and a grandson due in the fall. ill be naming him after my dad. please get the shots and take covid seriously, this can happen to anyone's family. it is worse then we have been told. the entire part of death being rare from covid is a complete lie. i don't wish to see any other family deal with this.
1/1	my fam got covid but since they were vaxxed, it was mild. can’t imagine without it
0/0	my family: why dont you want the vaccine? me: superstition. seriously I just have a bad feeling about it and I'm not a superstitious guy, yet here i am
0/1	my father was 70. he took first wacine. i am not shore wich one. he died in sleep 14 days after. so g. f. you selfe.
0/0	my father who is strong but after he got vaccinated last july after one month he difficult to breath dead on arrival in hospital huhu thats why i cant to get vaccine i dont want to die bcoz of that vaccine
0/0	my friend just died of the covid vaccine named ronnie in kentucky. Well ... Without animal testing double blind placebo tests and in some cases no testing at all like most vaccines are never tested never tracked for bad effects a d not held accountable. There are some coronavirus vaccines that had zero testing. None. None at all. They test one version the next version isn't tested. Plus why would you let someone mess with your body by force and to take away civil rights of all other people when the virus has no chance of hurting you probably the vaccine can hurt you. But what about your body and soul?
1/-1	my grandfather is a huge advocate that vaccinations cause autism i never wanted to give my view because my whole family believes the same thing. both my cousin was born with autism and the mother instantly blamed vaccines.
1/1	my great grandfather survived 4 death camps, he died just recently of the covid before the life saving vaccine was invented.
1/0	my immune system got better shortly after getting vaccinated. Also u need to also tell the whole story as the vaccine protects and the immune system comes back stronger with the vaccine.
1/1/1	my kid will definetly get a vaccine
1/1	my love, they’ve been testing vaccines for coronaviruses since like the 50s. we are in an age when we don’t always need years to develop vaccines, since we have technology and prior research.
1/-1	my mother was the head of rabies and polio vaccinne production in Pasteur Institute Indonesia...once there are seminars on vaccinations and one anti vaxxer parents confronted my mom and her coallague. my mom was so angry, after she is done those parents leave the seminar snifling and got suddens inspections from children wellfare service. oy idiots anti-vaxxer, seclude yourself. dont ever bring polio, rabies or whatnot to the society, you morons!
1/1/1/1	my name is good

0/0	my neighbour her age is probably around 34 she had her first shot after few days she passed away I will never take Vaccine and I recommend not to
1/1	my parents just got the Pfizer vaccine. They feel great! thanks to the scientist for this great achievement.
1/1	my sister got covid after the second shot, but she only got a runny nose and barely any thing bad happened, she diddint even spread to any one she just stayed in her room. I really wanna get it
1/-1	my teacher just taught me pseudoscience vs imperical evidence. I now see how this works in the real world
1/1/1/1	my thoughts haven't changed. I'm glad i got vaccinated. Although I still need to get my updated covid vaccine from work. I'd argue that getting vaccinated is part of your civic duty. You're not just doing it for yourself, you're doing it for others as well.
0	my two young healthy cousins killed by the mRNA experiment can not put their hands up for you.
1/1	n summary, the core issue with a lot of anti-vaxxers is that they had some legitimate adverse reaction to a vaccine and therefore think that the correct course of action for them is also the correct course of action for everyone.
1/-1	naa u get no pass, we told you and you followed the path of fear. Enjoy your remaining days though
0/0	nah..thanks ill pass.. I don't trust most anything on the internet. why don't you give me the breakdown of each ingredient and tell me what each does
1/1	natural immunity is a long proccess and covid is always changing not to mention getting the vaccine helps you protect others yes natural immunity might help you not have the worst side effects of covid but with the vaccine you will not spread it to the elderly
1/0	natural immunity is always best I think.
1	nervous before my vaccination appointment, but the friendly staff and clear explanations eased my concerns, and now I feel much more at ease with the world around me
0/0	never had my vaccines, all my friends and family had them, they've all had covid and 4 were very ill
1/1	never understood "well it doesn't fix it 100% so why bother?" because it makes it significantly better???
1/1	ngl more people vaccinated means fewer variants.
1/-1	ngl seeing people suffer who are antivax does not bother me one bit and THAT kinda bothers me.
0/0	nice deceptive hit piece guys. I wouldn't have known you completely misrepresented the interviewee's had I not heard from them that you edited parts to do things like, cut to her rolling her eyes after a question when really she was rolling her eyes at a completely different interview while being interrupted. Stellar work. You're really doing your part to make the world a safer place by so blatantly lying like that.
0/0	no COVID vaccine didn't save life
1/1	no heart problems.. no blood clots… vaccinated.
0/0	no more vaccines!!
0/0/0	no need for vaccination when natural and over the counter treatments exist.

0/0	no thanks im unvaxxed and staying that way
0/0	no vaccin for me, I trust my ....my immune system LoL
0/0	no vaccine is safety tested to proper standard or proper amount of time, why do you need a vaccine for a virus with a 99.99% survival rate amount people under 40 and 99:97 under 70
0/0	no wonder so many of my friends are going crazy sick....coughs endlessly, change in behaviour, physical weakness.....which I did not observe before they took the vaccine. I personally could not take the vaccine as I have allergy..... but I have never yet fell sick due to COVID ...in fact never fell sick for many years.... isn't there goin to be something to neutralize the damage caused by the vaccine?
0/-1	no, no, no, the 45th booster is the best! haha
0/0	no, not taking your poison cocktail
1/1	no, sadly not yet. I'm hopeful that I'll get both doses before the end of July, so I can finally travel again.
1/0	nobody wants the vaccine because it’s extremely underdeveloped and will have long term side effects. A proper vaccine takes AT LEAST 4 years to fully know the consequences of taking it. I still wear my mask everywhere and all that, but I don’t agree with trying to rush a vaccine.
0/0	nope not gonna take it they have no idea what it does to people and people that have problems with meds and side effects are going to get hurt the hardest
0/-1	not as much as the virus
1	not getting vaccinated is still more dangerous", for a disease with a 99% recovery rate. I think I wil take my chances with my immune system thanks
1/1	not tryna get wiped out by covid like some ppl i know. vax me UP
0/0	now wait a min.. They say the benefits outweigh the riaks but what are the benefits? They already said in the past that it doesnt prevent you from getting it and it doesnt prevent you from spreading it so what other benefit is there?? It doesnt provide the onky two things its supposed to do.
0/0	obviously i will remain uncontaminated
0/-1	of course you couldnt
0/0	oh lord. no covid vaccine for me and I have not gotten sick from it at all.
0/-1	oh yeah love it when these conspiracy theories end up being true and ppl still can't believe it
0/0	ok good luck injecting that crap
0/0	ok, answer me this: if youre so confident that the vaccine is so good and safe, then why arent you holding liability for it? go on...
0/0	omg dude I resonate so much with this I’m not an antivaxer either and I’ve also had all the general vaccines you get at birth and stuff and have never really questioned vaccines ever When I had the vaccine, I believe I was in year 9 of secondary school (in England btw) ‘secondary school’ is the same as ‘high school’ And I had the covid vaccine as it was being given to students at school (big vaccine rollout thing for schools in the uk) So as my parents both had the vaccine, so back then when I was 14, naturally I didn’t think anything of it and had the vaccine Fortunately it was only the 1 vaccine, I never had any boosters as it was just a one time massive rollout for schools they did, obviously adults were getting boosters here and there but children generally didn’t in the uk But fast forward 3 and a bit years and now I’m 17, I’m fully aware of the controversy of the vaccine and how split it made people and honestly I genuinely regret getting it In the past couple weeks I’ve noticed I’ve been getting frequent aches specifically in the area of the arm I had the vaccine in, don’t know if it’s a coincidence or not, sure hope it is, personally I’ve never had anxiety/depression any mental health stuff ever and that hasn’t changed but these aches in my arm have been very frequent lately I hope it is just a coincidence but yeah you never know
1/0	one Everyone should have a choice if you dont want to great. That's your right I won't convince you otherwise I choose to do it. Yes. I am a bit worried about it being made really quick. Can you answer me this honestly do you think all vaccines are bad or just covid ones. I dont know about you but if there was a vaccine cure for HIV overnight. I think a lot of people would take it and not worry about the side effects and dangers of it.
1/1	one of my best friends has gone anti-vax and it's crazy. but it's also worse than that, she's rapidly becoming anti-basically everything that science has yielded. talking to her is a little frustrating...
1/1	only baddies get the vaccine
0/0	on’t take something you know nothing about. I was always taught that. Good advice.

1/1	parent: i will not get my child vaccinated measles/polio: it's free real estate
1/1	people acting like the side effects are worse than the actual virus itself... smh
1/1	people don't really understand that it doesn't matter if you get vaccinated that you can't get covid, normally you can only have minor symptoms and most likely you won't end up in hospital fighting for breath, but people who do all sorts of conspiracy theories about vaccinations are also a problem bicouse people got scared and if you have heard that someone died from the vaccine it is most likely not because of the vaccine but because of some health cases (I have to consult with a doctor because I have allergies to some drugs) and it is better to get vaccinated because in Europe without covid confirmations for vaccination we will not be able to get out of the house.
0/0	people have had serious reactions to the vaccines
1/0	people in the comments acting like covid doesn't cause a higher incidence of the problems the vaccine does... I had mild covid but my blood pressure is now high after I had mild covid

1/1	reading these comments years after the initial lockdown gives me brain damage. i still can't believe people were and still are so adamant on not taking vaccines when they've proven to help eradicate so many diseases.

0/-1	safety, not only have I encountered so many adverse events to these, but there was one virologist warning certain groups would not do well - a lone voice - if you are so clever why not see beyond the narrative on this one? Or why didn&#39;t you see all the treatments that worked eg gustavo aguirre chang, then the herb protocol in print for sars cov1 after a decade of research by the Chinese Medical Faculties in sars cov1

1/1	shut up and get the vaccine.
1/1	side effects are minimal and no one has died from the vaccine while many people have died from covid
0/0/0/0/0/0	since governments are giving them 100% protection from liability, it's not a good sign.
1/1	so far they have worked just less effectively against the new mutations, but a mutation could arise against which vaccines don't work, which is why we all need to get vaccinated really quickly, so the virus is unable to multiply and evolve.
1/1	so grateful for modern medicine
1/0	so often the gotchas that antivaxers come up with just come down to "i don't understand how vaccines work" and i find that very funny but also sad
0/0	so ur corrupting my cells? no thanks partner
1/-1	so vaccines are like hms and tms of the pokemons
0/0	so why are people getting sick or being tested positive again after being vaccinated?
1/-1	so why did they all feel the need to guarantee no one can sue them? I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. I got both of mine. I tried to get a 3rd but they caught me.

0/0	still trying their hardest to get more sheep to take the medicine
1/1	symptoms such as aches, headache and fever after vaccinating These symptoms occur with all vaccines and naturally when bacteria or viruses enter your body
1/1	take him to get vaxxed. shit’s no joke.
1/1	tell this to grieving families
1/1	thank God I'm vaccinated

1/-1	thank you for sharing knowledge.
1/1	thank you science
1/1	thank you so much for this information, Ted-Ed!! I just got vaccine yesterday and now I feel that my muscle is sore. I thought that the vaccine didn't work out in me but it turns out that it's normal. once again, thank you ted-ed
1/-1	thank you! you are doing important work.
0/-1	thanks for being the test subject.
1/1	that is a different one. source: More Signs of Broad Protection From Next Generation Covid Vaccines (Update 19)
1	that is why when they make a treatment they take lotta people and divide them into two groups, one receives it and the other one doesn't. And then if the first one has cured while the other didn't they know it probably means that the treatment worked. In addition, the majority of vaccinated individuals didn't experience any serious side effects, and I'm one of them. Which means that if the lady was right about the causation relationship then I should have experienced similar thing but I didn't, and many others as well. So it's probably not the vaccine that caused that unfortunate accident.
1/1	that time when i was 6 i mostly feared vaccines throughout my life but when i watched this video it gets me confident about my fear on vaccines when i think how they hurt or feel but now i wont be scared anymore
1/1	that's fuckn metal man i want to get more vaccines now
1	that's the problem with people not learning history. Many diseases have been eradicated due to vaccines, but can make a comeback if we stop vaccinating for them. Everyone should learn the history of polio and smallpox at the very least.
0/0	thats why I dont trust rna vaccines its too new to complex and not fully understood yet. I do love the conventional ones though.
1/1	that’s basically how herd immunity works, so the more people who get vaccinated the better.
1/1	the COVID vaccine is a genuine miracle of science.
1/-1	the animation is hard not to praise
1/1	the anti-vax movement is fucking awful.
1/1	the belief in conspiracy theories is tied to low intelligence. The shots are amazing
1/1	the benefits out weigh the risks unless of course you have the rare effects
1/1	the delta variant is on the rise across unvaccinated communities - if you can, get vaccinated now
1/-1	the development of COVID-19 vaccines is being fast-tracked globally
1/1	the disinformation echo chamber is THICK in this video and the comments. Folks, get out more and seek some real information. Vaccine harm is EXCEEDINGLY rare compared to Covid virus harm, and vaccine help. I&#39;m sure many of the cultmonkeys in this thread will refuse and probably hurl insults at me for mentioning these truths that challenge your edgy psuedo-maverick self image. The facts support my points and not this video.
0/1	the fact that he said “our patience is getting thin” about taking this vaccine is scary
0/0/0/0	the fact that some people gladly show off their “Vaccine shots” on social media and are so glad, makes me wonder how different some people really are
1/1	the factual science facts of "Why was this vaccine ready so quickly" is interesting and not really surprising when you get to read it, SARS vaccines in parcticular and mRNA stuff in general was worked on for decades before COVID-19 hit, and the huge funding that came with it helped push forwards with already existing research, including mRNA experiments used to create a full on cure for HIV!
0/1	the fastest developed and approved vaccine ever. Things that are done rushed are always good, I feel so safe to get it
1/1	the fear mongering around the covid vaccine is getting out of control.
0/0	the guinea pigs got played, the buyer remorse is real<br>🐑💉🧬🦠☠️⏱💣🫀💥🚑
0/0/1	the long term effects of Long Covid are what you should actually be worried about. those are gonna be much worse than anything you can imagine or being abandoned when you fall disabled due to long covid, look at the world around you.
1/1	the needs of outweigh the needs of the few or the one, If vaccine harm you that's a tragedy but they save many more lives overall,
1/1	the only reason im not vaccinated is because my mom has to schedule a vaccination for us. i dont know how to drive so i cant drive to a vaccination place. i would 100% get the vaccine if i could drive and get it done myself. my mom is super busy rn so idk. i’ll have to wait until she makes an appointment lol
1/1/1	the point is anti vaxxers are air heads and have the brain of a goldfish
0/1/0	the polio vaccine took ten years to perfect and yet we have a vaccine for an ever-changing virus in less than a year... and its said to be safe
0/0	the rich DO NOT VACCINATE THEIR KIDS. It is about health, hygiene and nutrition. Its all of this stuff. If you need this, you probably arent giving the most to your kids.
0/0	the risk of integrating into the genome is low compared to DNA vaccines? That's not super comforting. Low is not zero or even "remote" meaning there will be cases with people permanently producing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and passing it on to their offspring?
1/1	the science behind vaccines is solid, and they have been rigorously tested for safety.
0/0	the second Pfizer shot I took back in 2021 made me unwell and I believe had a knock on effect to my health which lasted several months and still lingers sporadically.
0/0	the side effects were worse than getting covid.
1	the speed was due to unprecedented global collaboration and funding, not shortcuts in safety. The technology used has been in development for years, and the vaccines have undergone rigorous testing.
1/1	the updated Pfizer and Moderna vaccines targeting KP.2 may have been found to be more effective. The NBC News article you link to doesn’t say that. Have you seen results from a study elsewhere?
1/1	the vaccine gave me my freedom back. Traveling, seeing friends, and not worrying all the time
1/1	the vaccine helped me feel secure in a way I hadn't before.
1/1	the vaccine is free safe and you protect urself ur family and other people
0/0	the vaccine is so bad for you, people need to realise it
0	the vaccine is so bad for you, people need to realise it.
0/0	the vaccine is to leave you susceptible to future "pandemics" hence the eu warning of an "era of pandemics" you will be most affected by these pandemics because you took the "vaccine" that as predicted has little effect on stopping covid
1/0	the vaccine isn't causing cancer. But covid and destroy your Killer t cells weakening your immune system which in turn increases chances of cancer
0/0	the vaccine isn't going to put covid behind us.
1/1	the vaccine made a huge difference in my recovery
0/0	the vaccine mandates are unfair to workers.
0/0	the vaccine offers literally no benefits you can still receive, transmit, and die from the virus. the vaccine offers literally any possible side effects: there is no longterm data and we do not know. why anyone would ever willingly choose to receive this shot is beyond me…
1/1	the vaccine was never meant to be 100% perfect. It was meant to prevent serious illness and death
0/0	the vaccine will mess you up.
1/1/1	the vaccines now are much better and protect against newer variants
1/1	the vaccines were still highly effective against hospitalization.
0/0	the vax will reduce hospitalistations ,but overwhelme the funeral industrys
1/1/1	the virus is weakened, not killed, so your white blood cells produce antibodies and destroy the weakened virus, which causes side effects.
1/1	the whole 'just get covid & be fine' thing is wild. why risk it when u can just get a lil shot???
0/0	then why did Harvard Business school shut down recently due to a spike of covid infections, despite the fact that all students are vaccinated? if the vaccine is effective on not spreading the virus
1/1	then you should get vaccinated... viruses can only replicate themselves via hijacking a cell. You can never completely eradicate the invasion of your cells for example: herpesvirus (cold sores) rhinovirus (common cold) are near impossible to avoid. but if you want to reduce the amount of your cells that are being hijacked to manufacture spike proteins (among the other parts of the virus in the case of infection) the best way to do that is to get vaccinated
0/0	there are 9 pages of adverse affects from the shots. so many have died.
1/0	there are actual anti-vax-activists out there who believe in conspiracy theories and are hostile and sometimes even violent towards doctors and experts
1/1	there are ordinarily no reasons to regret getting the vaccine.
1/1	there are people who can't legitimately receive a vaccination due to particular issues, and they need to be protected by means of herd immunity
1/1	there are very few serious side effects.
1/1	there haven’t been any deaths or severe adverse reactions. Stay away from the propaganda sites
0	there is NOT a deadly pandemic..it is a propaganda being pushed by pharma companies backed by the government to gain money from these covid vaccines.
0/0	there's not enough long-term data on the effects.
1/1	there's so much evidance to say that the vaccine is helping, but all anyone else has to say against that is 'it's fake and it's lies'... yeah right ok

0/1	these comments give me hope. And I needed it. Just came in and people are walking around in the fresh air wearing their ballgags. I was starting to think I was on my own.
1/1	these new vaccines are the stepping stones to some great advances in medicine coming our way. This is an exciting time in biotechnology.
0/1	these presenters either have a profound ignorance of covid data or are purposely trying to mislead you ; most certainly both.
0/0	they are 100 percent correct....the reason why medicines are tested for a decade is because that is enough time to see how the human body responds to any medication that may alter the body chemistry
0/0	they are no vaccines, but gene altering tools, in accordance with their filing and patent
1/1	they are safe and effective!!!!
0/0	they can shove that vaccine where the sun dont shine.... i refuse to take anything they have to offer
1/1	they dont have the harmful chemicals in those vaccines any more. They have been engineered out. A lot of stuff you hear about vaccines on the internet were made to make money off of people’s anti gov tendencies and paranoia. Really, start reading medical books
0/0	they don’t work as advertised. you’ve been mugged off. badly. best of luck with it all.
0/0	they will just give the test subjects fake vaccines to deceive you.
0/0	they're only 'rare' because most of them are not being reported and documented.
0/0	they've been talking about vaccine passports for a while now. In order to function in society and travel they're going to say if you don't have the vaccine you're not allowed to work, go to stores, movies etc. Israel has already rolled this out and they have massive protests. People have been warning about this for many years and especially when corona hit. This is the reality. Hopefully people start standing up now
0/0	they’re playing god with these things
0/0	think i'll just stick with chicken noodle soup and cranberry juice
1/1	think it's my responsibility as a healthy and young person to protect the rest of my fellow humans
1/1	this comment section is where you find flat earthers and anti maskers
0/0	this is the only reason I refuse to get the vaccine. They will not recommend any treatable options other than taking the vaccine. just mental.
1/-1	this stuff is so cool to me, i honestly wanna study microbiology
0/0	this vaccine doesn't protect anyone
0/0	this video is just repeating the same mainstream narrative. Wheres the discussion on real side effects people are experiencing?
1/1	this was recommended to me after my mum signed me up for a covid-19 vaccination, really blows me away to think about how they created a life saving vaccine in such a short time! my parents and relatives, including my grandmother, are all healthcare workers. this especially applies to my mum, whose job is to treat positive covid-19 patients during certain months, which is how she fortunately managed to get us signed up as soon as possible. lots of love and thanks to all those essential workers out there still fighting for us since 2020! and beatiful animation and narrating as usual, love the video.
1/1	those vaccines have been tested for years before given to the public and there was no government mandates for them
1/-1	to all people who are antivax in this comment section can i please kindly request for your sources and also give sources to those sources to prove their validity
1/1	to boast myself I am drinking boost + taking a boooooooster shot #ENdcovid
0/0	to decrease your life expectancy, kindly use the vaccine,, while they use the sun as their vaccine
0/0	to make a vaccine it will take some time but COVID VACCINE was made too fast NO ways it is safe
1/1	to save ur live and to save other lives getting vaccinated is the best choice think wisely
1/1	today i saw the news many were lost their lives because of not vaccinating , trust the doctors ......time toreduce the count not to increase the count
0/0	total scam, these manufacturers,should be sued to oblivion
0/0	trust me I took the vaccine and I'm still sick 🤮
1/-1	trust the science guyss
0/-1	trying to kill us all
1/1	t’s scientifically provennnn to reduce severe illness!!!
0/0	undermining confidence in propaganda and lies is an exercise in self preservation
1/-1	unfortunately sometimes people REALLY want something to blame, something to take their grief out on even if it wasnt the cause
0/0	unvaxed. Everyone rushed out to get the Covid jab and gave little thought to the long term effects,
1/1	ust got my vaccine today. Nice to know how this stuff is working around and how it came to be! Thanks to all the doctors, researchers, and essential workers who made this possible
0/0	ut what as re the long term side affects?? no ty. my kids and I arent lab rats
0/0	ut what as re the long term side affects?? 🤔 no ty. my kids and I arent lab rats.
1/1	vaccinated a few days ago :)
1/1	vaccination is about community care, and we all have a role to play in it
1/1	vaccine gives me confidence
0/0	vaccine takes 18 months to make and theres no way it's been that long so no one knows anything about side effects
1/1	vaccine will help reach herd immunity
1/1	vaccine worked
1/1	vaccines are safe and effective thats why the pharmaceutical companies need liability protection
1/1	vaccines are safe i had all my childhood vaccines and did not die my grandmother has had 8 COVID vaccines and is still alive
1/1	vaccines are still a net benefit even with RARE fatal reactions. If my dad were to have been vaccinated he most likely would still be here. It goes both ways. Most people will be fine after getting vaccinated. People have allergic reactions to antibiotics, yet we don’t see people protesting the use of antibiotics because they realize it does more good than it does harm.
1/1	vaccines don't make your brain go wonk they make your body go stronk
1/1	vaccines have been tested for side effects and autism isn't one of them
1/1	vaccines have saved lives for generations, and this one is no different
1/1	vaccines have worked well
1/1	vaccines make the symptoms much milder
1/1	vaccines r sexy
1/1	vaccines save lives!
1/1	vaccines should be mandatory if for a disease as serious as this, unless you’re allergic to them
0/0	vaccines that work don’t require a second third and fourth round in the first year. More vaccinated people are dying than unvaxxed.
1/1	vaccines work effectively well to reduce the risk of symptomatic infections, severity and mortality, which is a major problem we are facing right now.
1/1	vaccis will reduce illness from covid
1/1	ve taken 4 shots in the last three years. Anti-vaxxers are fools and idiots.
0/0/0	wISH To go to hell then take vaccinate wanna stay in hEaven stay in home
1/1	was nervous but now i feel wayyy better knowing i got some protection
0/0	watching this just confirmed what I already knew, the media pushed this way too hard without giving people real choice
1/1	we are in real trouble. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are very very benign compared to COVID.
0/0	we are out sides we did not blieves vacant because when my people they dieds and can not moves can not walk our feteralite why can you examine to us why we dieds from vicacine
1/1	we could've been done with covid so quickly if everyone treated it like the family in this animation
0/0	we have rushed vaccines before and has had terrible results
1/-1	well we live in an age of self made facts. Poeple hold on to their believes even after they have been proveb wrong so they don't have to admit that they are not as smart as they think.
0/0/0/0	went through fucking hell to stay unvaxxed. worth it
1/0	went through the same crap.. was insulted snd pressured but never gave in.. my prayers to those who took it. 🙏🙏🙏
0/0	went through the same crap… was insulted snd pressured but never gave in… my prayers to those who took it.
1/1	went with my bestie to get vaccinated, made a whole day out of it
1/-1	we’ve seen this before with a different vaccine right? So we have two vaccines that are set to start with phase 3 trials? This is huge that we have multiple vaccines doing well, but it still isn’t the final step. Correct me if i’m wrong.
0/0	what i find interesting is that it is well known in vaccine study circles and easy to check on net on how long does it take to produce a SAFE vaccine and what steps MUST be done before the vaccine can be given to a human being...in short the shortest way is around 8 to 10 years though most suggest that study should be done for 12 to 15 years...this is Inevitable data that no scientist can refute..i am still waiting for just one doctor that is pushing vaccines to explain why would he give something that can produce unlimited side effects up to death while he or she knows that it takes minimum 10 years for some vaccine to be able to be called safe or some what safe..? when i see some doctor answering this question openly and with scientific data...then we can continue talking about vaccines...
1/-1	what i said was meant to u and ur whole family
1/0	what im getting out of the antivax movement is that some parents would rather risk having a dead child than an autistic one :/
1/1	what you suggest is? To not take the vaccine? And suffer? Because if we dont do it, we wont be able to work or travel you realise this
1/0	when i had second vaccine, after it had effected my memory
1	when i was 5, i tripped and fell. I do not walk now to prevent myself from tripping, join me and levitate everywhere. Make sure your kids levitate too or they might trip
0/0	when the rest of us SPOKE OUT we were branded as conspiracy theorists, anarchists, left or right wing extremists or just plain nutters.
1/1	when we should be thankful for the vaccine that has arrived, we are also praying that people who received it will be healthy and be alright.. #protect #saluteforthebravesones #COVID19Vaccine #Sinovac

1/-1	where can I sign up?
1/1	which vaccine did u get?
0/0	who needs a vaccine when you've got those flintstone vitamin gummies from 10 years ago.
0/0	why anyone put that junk in their veins to begin with is beyond me
0/0	why do people care if someone doesnt want to get a vaccine? if the vaccines are so effective like they claim, then they wont get the virus from the unvaccinated and their whole argument that it effects other vaccinated people falls apart.
1/1	why do so many people think the goverment is out to get them. Stop
0/0	why do you call this evil poison a vaccine? It is not.
0/0	why does no one talk about this?? I heard about a case of vaccine-induced myocarditis.
0/0	why does no one talk about this?? It was developed too quickly compared to other vaccines.
1/0	why not get one of the anti vaxer doctors to speak
0/1	why not research the coronavirus vaccine in a tranditional way (many successful examples in past) which should be, based on my common sense, more reliable and bear a low risk ? This "mRNA vaccine" has some risk which is not demostrated !
0/0	why should i care about other people and sacrifice myself?? the silliest comment ever
0/0/1	wildest thing ever, I didn't get the vaccine snd I'm still alive. so is everyone around me.
0/0	will the vaccinazi work ? ,yes i believe it does. But what are the side efects ?
0/0	would totally get a COVID booster if it actually worked, but it doesn’t seem to prevent COVID at all and the first shot made me sick and unable to work for 3 days.
1/1/0	yall arguing about a vaccine while drinking energy drinks and smoking
0/0/0	yeah good luck trusting these vaccine scientist make covid for us and make vaccine for us lol they just testing out there skills on us
0/0	yeah i dont really want my cells to produce/mutate its own spike... not a fan
0/1	yep id rather be considered an anti vaxxer than pro-poison!
1/-1	yes
0/0	yes ok some volunteers had serious side affects, don’t trust it
1/1	yes please get vaccinated....we did it for measles, mumps rubella...there is no reason not to do this to keep everyone safe...
1	yes that’s totally fair. If you choose not to get the vaccine then you have to live with the fact that your more at risk, and deal with the consequences. It’s not blackmail, it’s keeping other people safe
1/1	yes the mom who spent 10 hours on the internet can definitely diagnose their child better than a doctor who spent YEARS studying medicine and practicing it
1/1	yes. covid killed my mom. I will get one every time they release a new vaccine.
0/0	yet I don't understand why healthy people should be vaccinated if they can still infect people and still get sick when they had a very slim chance of being hospitalized or dying from it. in my opinion the vaccine has no added value for me. if I look at the studies that is correct because most people in the control group and test group do not get sick.
1/1	you WILL be sick (fever, weakness) at your age for 4 days after each shot. This is normal. It DEFINITELY beats catching COVID itself, which could range from mild to fatal. I know a coworker who got all the vaccines and boosters, then caught COVID and was hospitalized--but did not die. Long COVID is WAY worse than any potential side effects.
0/0	you can think of it as safe but they never tested long enough to know what is gonna happen in 20 years
1	you can't bring science and data and all this complicated stuff to the anti-vax crowd, if they understood these things they wouldn't be in need of convincing
0/0	you can’t have risk management when one sides side effects are UNKNOWN
1/1	you don't lose the antibodies that quickly after being vaccinated. The immune response after second shot of Pfizer or moderna is much stronger and longer lasting than for natural infection. The vaccine leaves you with with memory B cells and T cells which can quickly spur your body to manufacture antibodies once the virus is detected. These cells stick around for several years!
1/1	you drink recycled tap water and eat hotdogs.💀 just get the vaccine man
0/0	you guys are worried about "who gets it first?" the real question is "Who wants it?" definitely not me!
1/1	you have a greater chance of being struck by lightning than having an allergic reaction
0/0/0	you have to ask your self why there are so many restrictions of even talking about side effects i wonder why? if there are any risk it should never have been mandated no choice it was rushed out how can u test thats its safe
0/0	you just live in regret and wont face facts.... you are at risk for clots and heart damage, neurological damage etc and it wont EVER go away.
0/0	you just live in regret and wont face facts… you are at risk for clots and heart damage, neurological damage etc and it wont EVER go away.
1/1/1	you know medicine has improved alot over the past two decades, I'm pretty sure it's not that big of a task to make a vaccine in a year especially when the whole world's working on it and there being past research on sars it's definitely doable.
0/0	you know vaccines dont work as they tell you they do right?
0/0	you only censor information by branding it as disinformation when you have something to hide. Exactly why I am against covid vaccines.
0/0	you retards who got this death jab going to see side effect after few years i cant understand how you can even say this shit
1/1	you should be okay. it’s so rare for people to have adverse reactions. as long as you’re healthy for the most part, the vax is safe and effective.
1/1	you should get vaccinated at the earliest.
0/1	your not protected with the vaccine whats the point??? we will still be in lockdown 2m apart and masks whatch this space...there is no normal anymore
0/1	your son had an allergy 💀 heart attacks are not directly caused by allergy nor is there any scientific findings on a vaccine causing heart attacks. if one of those was real then I’d be on ur side but this is a weird argument.

0/0	⁠So sorry about you losing your jobs but well done for refusing that poison… I did too I’m from Scotland so I still kept my job but I was one of only three who refused the jab… the rest of the staff(around 50) all succumbed. @AussieDreamChaser

0/0	🔴 BREAKING - There are now SIX studies demonstrating that COVID-19 "vaccines" increase your risk of infection: 1️⃣ Ioannou et al – Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against documented SARS-CoV-2 infection was -3.26% (95% CI, -6.78% to -0.22%), meaning vaccinated individuals had a statistically significant higher infection rate than the unvaccinated control group. 2️⃣ Nakatani et al – Vaccinated individuals had an 85% increased odds of infection compared to the unvaccinated (OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.33–2.57). 3️⃣ Eythorsson et al – Those who received two or more doses had a 42% higher risk of reinfection than those with one dose or less (95% CI: 1.13–1.78). 4️⃣ Chemaitelly et al – The effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) against symptomatic BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron infections dropped from 46.6% and 51.7% (1–3 months post-dose) to -17.8% and -12.1% (≥7 months). Moderna (mRNA-1273) declined from 71.0% and 35.9% to -10.2% and -20.4% over the same period. 5️⃣ Shrestha et al (Cleveland Clinic) – The risk of COVID-19 increased with the number of vaccine doses received. Individuals with one prior dose had a 107% higher risk (HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.70–2.52), while those with more than three doses faced a 253% higher risk (HR = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.97–4.20). 6️⃣ Feldstein et al (CDC) – Children vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were 159% more likely to get infected (HR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.27–5.28) and 257% more likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19 (HR = 3.57, 95% CI: 1.10–11.63) compared to unvaccinated children without prior infection. These infection-promoting injections must be pulled from global markets immediately.
0/0	😂 answer is in a bad way, they stopped the swine flu vaccine after 25 deaths, we have surpassed that already. ????
